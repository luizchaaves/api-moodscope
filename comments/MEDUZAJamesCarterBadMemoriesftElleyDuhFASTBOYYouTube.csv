And thats coming from someone who is not a big nature fan ",en
32,"The continuous oscillation between C# and C has at minimum, an excellent hook effect.  I say at minimum because even better is that for some of us it induces a hypnotic, trance like effect which propels the song into a soul-piercing, uplifting experience.  Hats off to the writers of this song.  And furthermore, the songwriter had the guts to hold on to that C#, C back and forth throughout the entire song which gives the listener constant euphoria throughout; while other, lesser songwriters establish the hook, then make us suffer through a bunch of ""filler"" to make us starve for the hook so as to make the build up pay off.  But again, THIS songwriter boldly says, nah, I'm going to give you the beautiful, melodic hook through the entire experience.  Thanks so much for having the courage to do that and I can only pray that other songwriters will take note and do likewise.  God bless you Meduza and James Carter for improving my quality of life.  What better could you do for someone.",en
