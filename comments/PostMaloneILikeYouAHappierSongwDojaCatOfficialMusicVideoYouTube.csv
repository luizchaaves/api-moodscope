When you project love you get love. Not even trying to be poetic but I love this dude. Such a true and cool human. Often times I think the oldest souls live in the youngest bodies. It‚Äôs crazy to me how so many of us and myself included, spend so much time worrying about what other people think before we just do us and live for ourselves. I think that‚Äôs the greatest thing we could ever do for ourselves or God. Get into our power right now. Be our authentic self. We are all a blessing and a crucial piece of the puzzle.  Spread love because that is the only productive thing to do. It‚Äôs not about what you say - it‚Äôs about how you live and just exuding that peace and love that will change the world. God Bless you Austin! I feel so lucky to be walking this earth with such a beautiful person",en
