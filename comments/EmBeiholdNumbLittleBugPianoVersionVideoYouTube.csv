0,this song is our generations anthem right now,en
1,"I like that the words are the focus in this version, and the pace is slower, giving time to savor these lyrics.  The words in the first version share this limelight with the beat.  As a result, the two versions hit so different that they might be mistaken as two as two different songs.",en
2,"My favorite lyric in the original version was
""Like your hanging by a thread but you gotta survive, cause you gotta survive.""
THIS VERSION ADDS SO MUCH MORE TO IT. There's desperation,  you can feel the emotion clearly. Trying to cope by giving yourself a reason to live. Cause you gotta survive. I just love this version so much",en

I think the real instruments rather than the electronic ones (Not that those sound bad) just make such an improvement and really let her voice be clearer. The new ending part with those rising chords is just phenomenal, and I like those slight melodic changes you made in the vocals here and there. Oh and also the harmony you added to the last chorus was really cool.",en
