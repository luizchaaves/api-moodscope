48,"Nothing is more powerful than true love. For the last year, I've been cut off from everyone in my life. Ever since my girlfriend of 2 years passed away, I haven't been able to snap out of it. I can't sleep, I can't eat, I can't stop thinking. She was so good to me. Never cheated, never lied, never talked to me without saying I love you. Sometimes she would sit there and say it a thousand times. Every time we had an argument, she would say it until I calmed down. Hugged me when she knew something was wrong. Didn't speak when she knew I was tired of hearing what others had to say. Truly a humble human being. She always cried when she saw me. Now that those days are gone, all I can do is live how she wanted me to. I know it is going to be hard, but I'm grateful she gave me the opportunity to feel like someone understood. You see, it took me a little while to realize, no one really understands you except for your true love. No one. Everyone reading this, please know, you'll be ok. You've gone through the worst, I know. Don't stand down when you are called to the stage. Don't let people down when you make promises, and don't leave the people who need you the most.",en

This song reflects exactly my love life for 10 years. I have always been in love with him since my 3rd kindergarten. And it has always been mutual. Where is the problem then? Simply because neither of us has managed to confess our feelings to the other for 6 years. But in 5th primary, we were so close that we said it to each other at the same time . However, we did not get together. And in 6th grade, I had to change schools. But I couldn't say goodbye to him because we went straight away on vacation. We were separated for 4 years. 4 years where I tried to forget it, ""meet other people"", but nothing to do. Yet he even dated my best friend and broke her heart. Without effects. I can't blame him. Now, I'm in the same school as him, but we haven't seen each other for 4 years. He rebuilt his life and I rebuilt mine. But despite that, when I meet him, and I see that either he doesn't recognize me or he ignores me, I wait. I'm still waiting for the day when I can explain to him why I couldn't say goodbye to him, what he matters to me and clearly tell him how I feel. The day we will be together. The day he loves me.",en
