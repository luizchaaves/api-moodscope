 Jungkook, I heard Suga yesterday, who said complete nonsense that the team matters more than working solo. He is wrong. You have great vocal abilities.
You have a great presentation on stage. You should prepare your solo projects. Bts as a group is like puppets for little girls who ask you to wave your hand, come up with fan service.Jungkook, you are very talented, charismatic, charming, with a beautiful voice. Millions of your fans love you, they are waiting for any projects with you. We dream of your solo concert on the big stage, without the bts group, so that no one shouts over your voice.Jungkook, you will succeed, do as you want. You are the best.",en
