2,I remember when this first came out I was in my senior year and my philosophy teacher showed it to the class and the entire class we talked about the meaning behind each part. It’s genuinely an incredible video,en

Now I just need Donald Glover x Hiro Murai x Jordan Peele on a movie collab.

154,"Pure genius! As art goes when one interprets it, they make it they're own. To me this video depicts so many different thoughts, emotions, and visuals. In the beginning of the video seems so innocent   to me, then abruptly changes to something completely dark. I was shocked at first and then realized, America is not innocent, far from it. Our history is filled with unrest. Oh, by the way the word history should be known that it is not history it is ""His story"" not everyone's story. As a young white male growing up I could not understand why some kids were against Blacks, Asians, and Jewish people. I never heard it in my household or from teachers in school. As I and most kids there was a great deal of peer pressure. Because of that I kind of never called it out until I was a teenager to my peers, but I should have. I am a well educated white male and I want all to know that racism is not inherent, it is a learned behavior that has been passed down generationally. Aside of that this video to me shows the unyielding violence in our country. Today every parent who sends their kid off to school has to worry if they will be alive when they pick them up.
