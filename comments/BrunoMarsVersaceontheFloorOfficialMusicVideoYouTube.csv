0,Bruno Mars is the type of guy who disappears after like 2 years but every time he comes back he produces a hit,en
1,"If you ever get to see this man in concert, he never disappoints. He is one of those rare people who pours a love of life and passion into everyone around him. You cant help but be swept up and along with him. And Zendaya...we have watched her blossom from childhood into an intelligent, beautiful, confident young woman who is not only finding, but asserting her place in this world. What a delightful combination.",en
2,It’s been 5 years and this is the first time that I watched the MV. I never knew Zendaya is in it lol,en

And her soft, besotted emotions expressed here are so leagues apart from her regular personality, it's unbelievably impressive, especially as she needed to do it without a partner to reflect off of. I'm not surprised Tom Holland spent years trying to win her over. Hat's off to talent!",en
