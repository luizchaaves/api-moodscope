266,Hi Marine I love you new look but you don't need to cut your hair or change anything about yourself to please anybody else all you need to do is please yourself and when people please themselves and they are happy they're happiness rubs off on others and you know that anybody ever ever make you feel that you're not just as good as everybody else is because you are you are a wonderful woman you have a beautiful voice I remember reading something about you wanting more than people posting about you maybe you could go on a short two week or three week tour and around the United States and do some singing maybe that would get you what you want? You could go with your husband and you could do the songs you do together and the songs you do apart but personally I think that you don't really need people in crowds cheering for you because people are already cheering for you and love you just the way you are and love all your music we are the people who can't afford to go to concerts who don't have cars who watch you on our cell phones and we are so happy to see you you are just such a beautiful human being and a loving couple and your husband is so sweet and your music that you make together is so beautiful and the songs that you sing apart are just as beautiful don't ever let anybody take that away from you you're happiness comes from you from deep inside your heart not what you look like not what people think of you in public it comes from you from deep in your heart and as long as you can make yourself happy and you can be happy yourself that's when the happiness rubs off on others I don't let others try to make you think you need them in person to make you happy by cheering for you because it doesn't work that way happiness comes from inside oneself in our heart that is the only place we achieve true happiness so do what you need to do go on concerts go on TV travel but I always remember to be true to yourself and that the happiness comes from within no one else can make us happy no one else can give us what we need we need to give it to ourselves lots of love from a 60-year-old it is truly what is inside that makes you happy that was on the outside and now what other people think so always make yourself happy and may God be with you from all your fans here in Maine we all love you dearly and we hope you were able to find your happiness within yourself,en

A child doesn't know WTF they want to be when they grow up at that age (one week it's a pro football player, the next it's an astronaut). It's an adults RESPONSIBILITY to steer them in the right direction. Not allowing an 8yr old (or whatever young age we're talking about) to decide their gender before they even mature is not only a parents right it is their RESPONSIBILITY. You are ignorant but unlike a lot of people I will continue to support and listen to your music.",en
