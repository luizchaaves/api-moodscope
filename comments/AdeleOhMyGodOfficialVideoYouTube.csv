It's refreshing to see someone who brings forth what a true artist needs: an impeccable voice and not just any voice - a memorable one. You can turn on the radio and because her voice is so unique, you can tell it's her. Adele, in this record, has shown a sense of maturity but also a sense of honesty. She has always been honest in her songs, but inside this one that was recently gifted for us, there is an invitation to the chambers of her heart where we could appreciate her sorrows, anxiety, happiness, playfulness and openness about her past/future experiences. I can't but thank Adele for her records. I am a director from Canada, and working my ass off to become known for my artistry and she definitely pushes me to be out there. And indeed, I succeeded.

I have been listening to Adele for over twenty years. I remember listening to Chasing Pavements ions ago on an underground sound station.

800,"Imagine, if you died right now, where would your soul go for eternity? Was everything you ever did without purpose, and never really mattered, or will you just stop existing, after you draw your last breath? Think about this, it is the most important question of your life. There is only one chance to get it right, and it is in this lifetime. Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. Heaven is real, place of eternal bliss and perfection. Hell is real, place of eternal suffering and torment. You‚Äôre going to spend your eternity in one of those places. God's will is, that nobody would perish. One day, each and every one of us must appear before the Judgement Seat of the Holy Righteous God, and to give an account, how we have lived our life. The only way to get to Heaven is, if you‚Äôve never broken any part of God‚Äôs Law, in other words, if you‚Äôre without sin, and every single one of us have sinned. Not one person, who‚Äôs not born again from above, of the Holy Spirit, and is still in their sins, can inherit the Kingdom of God, for the wages of sin is death, and eternal damnation. Our sins separates us from God. That is why God in His love and mercy sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to atone for our sins. He left Heaven‚Äôs Throne, was God in flesh, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of a virgin, lived a holy perfect life while being in same temptations as we are, yet without sin, was condemned unjustly to death, although being innocent, was beaten, mocked, flogged, and crucified on the cross, and gave up His life and Blood willingly on our behalf, for there is no forgiveness of sins without the shedding of blood, but Christ, the spotless and unblemished Lamb of God, the Perfect Sacrifice once and for all, took the punishment of our sins on the cross, sacrificed Himself for us and paid the sin debt in full, past, present, and future, so we can be forgiven of all our sins, and be redeemed back to God, after the fall in Paradise by satan's tempting, through the Holy Precious Blood, which Jesus shed on the middle cross at Calvary, in His everlasting love towards every single one of us.",en
