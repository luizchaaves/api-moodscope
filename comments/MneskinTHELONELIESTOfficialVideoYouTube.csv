0,"It’s a masterpiece. It shows death of a loved one, the pain, the loss, but also people holding you back for staying here with them. The pain you got from losing someone but having people who care about you and want you to stay here with them, not following death but staying alive. This shows the strength and caring friends who we all need in this life. You made me feel like I’m not alone. Thank you Måneskin",en

4,"I'd say that this is one of the best songs that was ever created. It's rare  to see everything fit so absolutely perfect. It was made for a voice like Damiano's because it can carry the sad moments with all the breaks(if i may call them that way) he has in it. The guitar often feels as if it's crying, but the song despite being sad also has a note of attempted happiness, i think. As if the loneliness is accepted or at least attempted to be. And as i said, it all blends so well together, that it sounds perfect. Definetly one of the few perfect songs.",en
5,"I rarely comment on youtube but I really like your songs and especially this one. You released the audio version just a few days after I lost my grandma.

And this song helped me to finally cry, after a few days of keeping everything inside. It is really beautiful and hurtfull, but I like it. It will be forever the memory of my grandma. Ti amo ",en

60,"Whenever I would share music with my son he would insist on hearing the audio only first so that it would not be clouded by the video.  I'm glad I heard this song and appreciated it for it's beauty first before seeing this video which took it to another level.  I've always been someone who feels music anyway.  This official video for it symbolizes my son's life and death in so many ways.  His story was much like Nikki Sixx's only without the happy ending.  He was a musician.  He played many instruments and settled on the bass guitar.  He wrote kickass rock and roll songs, formed a band, and became addicted to heroin.  They only got 2 tracks fully recorded for what was to be their first EP.  His addiction got in the way.  Near the end everyone turned their backs on him and ran away from him just like in this video.  But his bandmates and I helped him back up when he fell.  But he pulled away and continued towards his destiny but looking back at us with so much love and gratitude but silently saying, ""I'm sorry.  I must go.""  His bandmates were all pallbearers at his funeral.  This video tells his story and describes the pain in my heart from losing him.  You all have sick talent and I pray you go all the way with it and it doesn't get wasted like my son's did.  Keep rockin' like you do.",en

Their lyrics, sound, mix, performance and dedication is extraordinary. They have a mysterious way about them that's hard to explain - they have the uncanny ability to penetrate your soul and stop you in your tracks. It's mesmerizing and fascinating to experience, and to see how intensely they connect with their audience is truly amazing. This band resonates and I totally get why they grew in popularity so quickly across the globe. As long as they keep their head on straight and continue to surround themselves with smart management and advisors, their staying power will last a very long time. Maneskin is like a fine wine because they will continue to get better with age and they are great already. Their journey is in its infancy and I can't wait to see what's next!",en
