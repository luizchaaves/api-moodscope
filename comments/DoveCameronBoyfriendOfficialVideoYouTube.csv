539,In Anderson Indiana we have a performing arts and were one of the major performing arts centers at least of Indiana and in the 90s it was a big deal. I accidentally sent a message before it was finished.. I wanted to open up a burlesque theater back in 97 when I graduated high school as I was going on to college at Ball State this past year when I heard this song I thought this song would be incredible in the show and if my dream ever comes true I promise to let all of you know with one simple way I have which is a wink of my right eye.. so I thought at the end of the song when she said plus all my clothes would fit it would fade to dark and all you would see was the wink of the performers right eye! But this is truly an erotic and beautiful song and I'm truly grateful for its existence and I hope to hear many more songs that sound just a soulful and wise and a little bit of a warning to those who think whether we are gay or straight male female no matter the color no matter the gender that we are inferior in any way or less valuable and that their superiority gives them security that no one can sleep in an offer another person a better life possibly one that they never knew could exist just by taking a risk..
