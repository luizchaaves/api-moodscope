The film opens with ‚ÄúOphelia.‚Äù This is really one of the only parts of the film in which The Lumineers actually appear.

The story begins with the youngest girl in this video, she's young and in love.  Her father has died and the love of her life asks her to leave, it shows what would happen if she would have left (which is ultimately fall deeper in love, explore, get married, and essentially live a happy fulfilled life.). However in reality she doesn't leave with her true love, instead she stays and he leaves, skipping over to the song Angela (the middle age women) she is now pregnant with another mans child and is living an unhappy life, she decides to leave one night, which ends in her and her new man getting a divorce, now onto Cleopatra (the woman driving the taxi) she is older now and drives the taxi for fun and sees many people that remind her of her and her love.  She visits with the song she gave birth too and states that god gave her two blessing, birth and a divorce, now onto the 4th and final song, she is way older now and is now in a nursing home, she explains to the aids there that she was so amazing when she was young, and since they are a younger generation they don't quite understand, so they just shrug it off.  She has a collection of the love of her life's pictures and she regrets not going with him, she knows she is going to die in the nursing home, old and alone.  The what if moment comes when she decides to leave the nursing home.  The end.  Ultimately this  ballad is a lesson about choices, regrets, and life.  She regrets not leaving with her soulmate which in turn leads to her living a depressing life, in which the only blessing are birth and a divorce.  You're very welcome.",en

My grandfather had been admitted to hospital, for he was seriously unwell with an issue with his pacemaker. I listened to ""My Eyes"", there was just something about it which screamed, ""You need this"". The next day, my grandfather died. He had a tragic life, similars to this Cleopatra's.

She always told me about life and about the decisions you have to make and that life can be very hard. I really liked the love she had for nature and animals. When it was night and I needed her, we always stopped on the mountain to look for deers or foxes. I asked her why she was a taxi driver and she told me that she liked the stories of the people in her taxi, and she also liked the youth. Everytime when the taxi was full of youth she said: ''I wish that I was young again.''. This lady was so nice and somehow she didn't had a family. She never really talked about it, everything she always told me was that she was happy that she divorced many years ago. I don't know if she had children but I really hope she does. I knew the song Cleopatra before I met her and in my head she really was Cleopatra. But I hope so much that she doesn't end alone because no one deserves that.",en

229,"Eu amo esse album e amo a mensagem que ele transmite.Apesar que vejo muitas pessoas nos coment√°rios que interpretaram a hist√≥ria do clipe errada. Cleopatra escolheu o amor da vida dela.√â algo que se voc√™ n√£o se atentou aos detalhes, voc√™ n√£o entende. Em Sleep on the Floor,ela escolhe seguir o amor da vida dela ap√≥s a morte do pai. No final,o clipe n√£o mostra,mas eles sofrem um acidente na estrada e ele morre. Isso se confirma pela cicatriz que aparece no rosto dela nos clipes de Angela e Cleopatra e pela cena no clipe de Cleopatra, onde ela jovem, com a cicatriz recente e com o cabelo um pouco maior do que estava em sleep on the floor(provavelmente pucos meses depois do aciedente),visita o tumulo dele. Outra prova,√© a tatuagem que ela fez durante a viagem deles. Se voc√™ prestar aten√ß√£o,ela tamb√©m aparece no bra√ßo dela em Angela, o que confirma que a hist√≥ria de sleep on the floor,realmente aconteceu. Acho que a mensagem √© que voc√™ faz escolhas na vida,e no caso de Cleopatra, ela escolheu a pessoa certa, por√©m n√£o pode ficar com ela. E por isso,ao longo dos clipes ela est√° sempre relembrando o passado. Ela teve que seguir a sua vida sem ele, mas nunca o esqueceu. Se casou,teve um filho,se separou e no fim da sua vida,ainda imaginava como teria sido se ele n√£o tivesse morrido. Ou se n√£o tivesse escolhido viver aqule amor, mesmo que brevemente. Em todos os clipes,mostram ela no suposto lugar do acidente,pois ela est√° sempre voltando l√° durante varias fases de sua vida para relembrar.Cleopatra n√£o √© sobre algu√©m que se arrepende de n√£o ter escolhido o amor.Cleopatra √© sobre uma mulher que perdeu o amor da vida dela e precisu seguir em frente pela vida,sempre relembrando e sempre se perguntando como seria sua vida se suas esolhas ao longo dela,tivessem sido diferentes.",pt

237,"Whenever I travel home from work I would play any Magnetic Zeros song and after, random songs would follow and these songs from the Lumineers would play and I wasn't familiar yet with their music but I loved it, I fell in love with their songs and these 4 songs (Ophelia, Cleopatra, Sleep on the floor, and Angela) would play. It gave me a road trip vibe feels, but not the fun road trips but more like seeing empty offices, abandoned buildings on the road side, seeing couples walking home, a mom and her kid holding a new toy kind of road trip where you sometimes reminisce what have happened there before and what memories have occurred in those places or what these people are going through in life (sonder). I haven't seen this video yet until now and behold it really is about that feeling (Sonder). Last night, I was travelling back home (I haven't seen this video yet) and these songs are playing and I couldn't stress this enough when I heard this, what Cleopatra was feeling while driving or what this video is making me feel right now is what I felt last night.

Por√©m na realidade ela n√£o vai embora com seu verdadeiro amor, ao inv√©s disso ela fica e ele vai embora, pulando para a m√∫sica √Çngela (a mulher de meia-idade) ela agora est√° gr√°vida de um filho de outro homem e est√° vivendo uma vida infeliz, ela decide sai uma noite, que termina com ela e seu novo homem se divorciando, agora em Cle√≥patra (a mulher que dirige o t√°xi) ela est√° mais velha agora e dirige o t√°xi para se divertir e v√™ muitas pessoas que a lembram dela e de seu amor.

The story begins with the youngest girl in this video, she's young and in love.  Her father has died and the love of her life asks her to leave, it shows what would happen if she would have left (which is ultimately fall deeper in love, explore, get married, and essentially live a happy fulfilled life.). However in reality she doesn't leave with her true love, instead she stays and he leaves, skipping over to the song Angela (the middle age women) she is now pregnant with another mans child and is living an unhappy life, she decides to leave one night, which ends in her and her new man getting a divorce, now onto Cleopatra (the woman driving the taxi) she is older now and drives the taxi for fun and sees many people that remind her of her and her love.  She visits with the song she gave birth too and states that god gave her two blessing, birth and a divorce, now onto the 4th and final song, she is way older now and is now in a nursing home, she explains to the aids there that she was so amazing when she was young, and since they are a younger generation they don't quite understand, so they just shrug it off.  She has a collection of the love of her life's pictures and she regrets not going with him, she knows she is going to die in the nursing home, old and alone.  The what if moment comes when she decides to leave the nursing home.  The end.  Ultimately this  ballad is a lesson about choices, regrets, and life.  She regrets not leaving with her soulmate which in turn leads to her living a depressing life, in which the only blessing are birth and a divorce.  You're very welcome. (Copied from Todd Goodell)",en
