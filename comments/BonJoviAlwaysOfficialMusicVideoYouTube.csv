Her sister trying not to lose her, according to what she told me, she analyzed my songs/poems for her and put them together as a whole. To simply tell her that these songs/poems were dedicated to another girl. Being influenced by her sister, she asked not to see me again. Well I tried to explain to her but she was so stubborn that she didn't understand. I realized from that moment that what I created was the best for my soul and my heart. Always never say good bye were the BON JOVI songs that inspired me a lot. Thank you very much forever.",en

It brings tears to my eyes, full of joy and pride in him. He turned out to be a better man than I'll ever be. He turned my failures into bright accomplishments for himself. He'll never know how proud I am of him because we're estranged and I've lost everyone I ever cared about. He did good. It's all I could ever ask for.
