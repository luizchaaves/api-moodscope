558,"You never feel you will find the one. Your heart is dry and empty, and you miss the life you never had. So you go to sleep, all alone. You wake up, only not in your bed, but in another alternate universe. The colors are sharper than ever, everything is greater and more beautiful. But above everything else, everything is alive and happy. It is the middle of the night, yet everything is illuminated by the moonlight. You are dressed in the finest attire, with colors you've never seen before stitched beautifully throughout your clothing. You stand on an incredibly intricately designed pier- one made of the finest marble and gemstone. There is an immense ocean, and you admire the way the moon glistens over the water. You feel at peace in this universe- a feeling of belonging and tranquility like you have never felt. You see a feather, so beautiful and graceful in its fall- floating onto the water. You notice something moving behind you. When you turn and look, you suddenly feel emotions you didn't know existed. Emotions so deep and profound, you feel as if you could pass out from the pure ecstasy. The most beautiful girl you have ever imagined is right there, walking back on the pier. She looks into your eyes, and even though she is quite far from you, you are transfixed on how beautiful hers are. She motions you to follow. And there you go, chasing this angel of heaven down this seemingly endless bridge. She pranced effortlessly and immaculately, like a ballet dancer on stage. It was then she stopped, and ran to you. You both look into each others eyes, and you both smile. You dance by the moonlight, and you feel love for the first time. You know it, and every time you look into her eyes, you fall further and further. She takes your hand, and together you walk hand in hand to the end of the bridge. You find yourself in a town, yet with no people. It looks as if it was from an ancient time, yet it is so new and otherworldly. Only one place is illuminated, a small restaurant, with a table set up in front perfectly for the two of you. You help your love sit down, and you take a seat across. And you enjoy the finest meal you've ever indulged in. You want to converse with her, but you can't. There is no words to be said. You feel a wave of shame and unworthiness. You wish you had a perfect body, and a perfect soul. Then you would be worthy, you would be perfect. But you suddenly realize- you are. Finally, you are. When you finish the dinner, you and your angel run about the whole town, through valleys, up towering peaks and mountains, across the beaches. The stars were magnificent and many, and you picked out formations as you stargaze with her. You realize just how special she truly is. Every detail, look, and aspect about her is only one could dream of. You fall asleep in each others eyes, and smile as you snooze away the night you two had. A great trembling awakes you, and the sky is blood red. The moon is now gone- and the town is on fire. The mountains were collapsing, the sea rocking, and the valleys splitting. You look into each others eyes, and realize that together, you have everything you ever want or need. As you embrace, the universe and reality collapses, and everything was gone forever. Everything. You wake up, immersed in sweat. Soon, tears well up in your eyes, and you realize what just happened. You become grateful for it, but distraught of losing whatever it was. You get out of bed, and play this very song. The words couldn't have meant more. Thank you for reading, if you did.",en

831,"This song is catchy because it sounds alot like Roy Orbison's song : On The Blue Bayou"" . Thomas Yorke lead singer of radio head was born on October 7th 1968 the same year as me the Chinese year of the monkey. He saw a girl at one of his concerts before he made this song ""creep"". He stalked her for a month, finally he asked her out and she told him to F..... Off!!! And stop following me!!!! This broke his heart, and this made him write this song. He hates it because it will allways remind him of her rejecting him. Plus it's sound is the same sound as Roy Orbison's , Blue Bayou song just different words!!! Thomas Yorke will never admit this, but , I know!!! Any way this song is on my top 100 list of all time and I sing it down to a T. This song can make you or break you. If your feeling really bad and very depressed don't listen to it, because it feeds your already depression. People have killed themselves out of self pitty while listening to this creep song. If your feeling alive and groovy it will lift you even higher because it can do that too!!!! Been rejected by the one you love eats you up inside out and it kills you, and by then it's to dam late to realize you where trapped in an infatuation. Good luck.",en
