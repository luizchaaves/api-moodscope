2,"I'm 58 years old, and I get this song 100%.  That feeling when your older boyfriend manipulates you but you don't see it for ages.  You do everything you can to please them, and yes - you shut out your family and friends.   The lyrics described me at 22 after 5 long years.  Brilliant, brilliant song by Billie & Finneas",en
3,Her tone and pitch when she's singing about being happier without the someone this song is directed at exposes how exhausted she is. Then her power comes in when she sings of all the betrayal and pain and that she simply wishes to be left alone in peace.,en

Every voice is golden Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è",en
32,"This song is so beautiful and relatable. I know exactly what this feels like to love and do every single thing you can to please them no matter what, to be manipulated and used..not even knowing it, even shutting out your family and friends.  But after everything..after cutting that one heavy string..you finally feel free and won't take any more of it. And even though it hurts, you become stronger than you were before.",en

To listen from the first song to the very last song reminded me how I am always listening to Taylor's Red TV.

And this exact feeling is present on Happier than Ever, as well.",en

78,It's been 4 years but it'll never gets old.. Such a masterpiece song,en
79,"I don't know if I interpreted the MV right, but based on my understanding, it started as calm, and I think the serenity represents her life. I think that is right before her career started. Everything was vividly glowing yet simple. The light is yellowish which reminds me of her ""Don't Smile At Me EP"". When she opened the door, it's dark outside. I think that represents her debut album, the peak of her career. The moment she became the subject of the public eye. The water represents the negative criticisms, hate, and invalidations people thrown at her; saying that she is untalented and overrated. There was a moment that those things drowned her, and she really did everything to save herself from drowning. Eventually, she had learned how to deal those things. She literally shrugged off the fact that she is being criticized negatively. ",en
