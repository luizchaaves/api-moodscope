574,"Wine, in small quantities, can even be helpful. If you choose from drinks. Beer, too, no more than 0.5 liters per day, is useful as a source of vitamins, an energy drink (it contains a lot of calories) and as a natural antidepressant. Of course, all this is also in natural juices, fruits and vegetables, but if it is difficult to immediately get rid of alcohol, then you can reduce the dosage. By the way, in France, a woman drank wine and smoked and lived to be 115 years old. And the actor Vladimir Zeldin did not drink or smoke, he lived to be 101 years old and played on the stage of the theater until the last. Genes also determine, but by 30%. Wonderful Katy",en
575,"Rhythmic gymnastics reduces the growth of the child and sometimes even injures. If you want the child to be healthy, then at first it is better for him to go swimming, this is how the lungs and their volume develop.

Just do not overexert, according to well-being. If there are too many loads at school, then breaks should be given if the child does not want to go to training due to lack of strength. Enough one, maximum two classes per week. And in training, do not overcome your limit, when your head is spinning and circles before your eyes, gradually, without violence, endurance is built up. The child is growing fast. Physical activity gives rest from mental activity at school. Also your social circle, positive. And of course, you can combine all this, for example, with vocals. After 2-3 years of swimming, from 4-5 years. Classes with cyclic anaerobic loads, until the end of growth. And then to any other areas of sports or acting. This is my subjective opinion based on personal experience and recommendations of trainers",en

634,"There are people who only understand strength. Who is stronger, he is worthy of respect, he is right. It's like a child whipping a cow home that can't do anything about it. If a person is a rational being, a creature that creates, created the whole civilization and what can wipe it off the face of the earth, together with him, can he argue that only the power of law, and the mind is an unaffordable luxury. Whether civilization was created by force and muscles alone, or did dreams, ideas, years of work, ups and downs, disappointments and success stand behind the force. So what prevents people from agreeing on peace with each other, even if the political system is different and debit and credit do not always give a positive balance and the gross product is less than the money supply? On the one hand, nuclear energy, gadgets, on the other hand, coal and oil energy and the third side, the side of the planet that gave birth to us, which is changing and can change its appearance, even magnetic radiation that keeps the atmosphere, which one of its main consumers does not appreciate so much, having invented a lot ways of destroying their own kind and other species, not thinking about its balanced nature and the fragility of life on earth itself and man in particular, who cannot live without nature that feeds him. Life, a miracle of nature, which appeared over millions of years of evolution due to the confluence of many factors, is so ruthlessly and unreasonably selected. Territories that are billions of years old are divided by creatures that arose on them thanks to the integral structure of one planet, and not its individual conceptual boundaries that exist on maps, but not in nature. Who will divide, air, heat of the Sun or tides from the Moon? A man is small and weak, and any roadside stone or stick can take away his life, but his conceit about himself is greater than the universe. This is easy to understand by comparing it with the size of the Earth, the Sun, the Galaxy, the time of their existence. You don't have to be a seer to understand and see this. The complexity of urban thinking gives rise to heaps of problems that are simply and safely solved by the inhabitants of villages, villages, and inhabitants of nature. To whom money is not really needed, with due work, nature, the Earth gives them everything. And they dream of mechanical devices that can make their work and life easier, and not of the most complex devices for killing their own kind. Those villagers whom city people consider almost fools feed city people who, after many years of study, are not able to make any product on their own or grow plant food on the asphalt of cities or a meat animal or bird to even feed themselves. .

704,"It's amazing that Christians kill each other. Yes, even on such a massive scale. Cain and Abel are a vivid example of this, but at that time they did not know about God's law, his love for the living. One presented soulless grass, the other killed animals, never realizing that the creator god is upset when his creations are killed, even animals that have eyes, ears, internal organs similar to the human body, the same red blood. And it was said in the Holy Scripture that everything that grows, edible fruits from trees and bushes, are suitable for human food. That is, a person was created as a vegetarian, this is understandable even by the structure of the teeth. Not everyone will raise their hand to kill an animal, because a person is merciful. But when they fool his head with various information, cloud his head with already allowed alcohol and drugs, he himself does not understand what he is doing and deliberately killing people like himself, and once he could not even kill a chicken for his soup. How many of these Cain-Abels are now sacrificing each other, thinking that they are doing good deeds and will go to heaven. Whether this is pleasing to a merciful god is not known, all the more evidence of his existence was never found, just as the coronavirus did not find proof of the existence of its creator. But there are still other sins, even if gluttony is not so dangerous for others. Why choose such a grave sin ",en
