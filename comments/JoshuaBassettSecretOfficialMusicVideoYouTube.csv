Then, pretty soon Olivia escaped all the blame and left him alone with the whole world’s eyes on him. (Hence the flashing lamps). He couldn’t have any time to process what happened or talk it out with Olivia. Josh standing up to the girl is what he wishes he could have said/done with Olivia. He wishes the world would have listened to both of them instead of just her. It’s heartbreakingly beautiful symbolism. You can tell how much thought Joshua and his team put into it.",en

The girl (presumably Olivia) wears a bright orange dress for all to see, which can be analyzed as her writing driver's license and sour about the breakup between the two, which the whole world praises.
For Josh, the inside of his suit jacket is orange, (which we can see when he takes it off). He has held back his feelings of 2021 toward the breakup, maintaining his silence as angry liv fans come for him. With the release of crisis, secret, and set me free, he's finally sharing the emotions that he's withheld for all of 2021 after driver's license.

P.S. I don't think Joshua deserves those hates and death threats he's receiving, he had feelings too. It's the toxic fans that make things worst. We weren't perfect to put someone down by sending death threats and hate. There is nothing wrong with Olivia's song but there's something wrong with those fans who overreacted to the situation of the two. Those songs were not giving us a license to insult someone.

421,"Just my thoughts on the symbolism in this video:
The girl storming out is supposed to depict Olivia because she is unhappy with the relationship and thinks Joshua doesn't love her anymore. The kiss they shared doesn't feel the same for either of them anymore. Joshua is doing all he can to please her because he loves her, but the feeling he is getting from her is that she isn't interested in him anymore. Joshua driving with the girl shows how he was teaching Oliva to drive. The kiss was what they shared every time before they went their separate ways. Olivia and Joshua both remember the kiss as good memories until one day it was ruined because of one wrong kiss when everything felt like it was slowly falling apart. The white car parked in the driveway near the front yard reminds them of each other this entire time because of their driving memories together. Olivia might have suspected that this kiss was how Joshua found out about her secret. He makes a direct reference to ""good 4 u"" when he said, ""good for you for fooling everyone."" When the girl is walking away from the room he is in, he sings, ""you had me tricked for 16 months"" which kind of makes it seem like Olivia was seeing her current boyfriend or sneaking around when they were in a relationship together. The girl walking away also could depict Olivia just finding success or a new lover and walking completely away from him. The orange and blue theme shows how it was all fun and games at first and then the problems came around because it shows a theme of the hot sun and cool water. The confrontation started when feelings of anger and blame came along. He is singing in the orange room because he is expressing his emotions on how he feels about her in this entire situation just like Olivia was about him. The blue room is where everything was good in their relationship and Olivia being depicted by the girl in orange messed it up with her feelings for someone else and brought the end of their relationship. Also, since he said that Oliva is really cold towards him also could be why he is confronting the girl in a blue room. The lights are flickering because now he is the one expressing his emotions after being silent all this time and it is messing with the story Olivia created about what happened between the two of them. The girl depicting Olivia was calm until he confronted her about the truth of what happened and the secret. Joshua is trying to prove Olivia's story as a lie and expose that she has been keeping a secret this entire time.  He depicts himself as the calm, private individual with blue while she is the troublemaker and one to blame in the orange. When Joshua is being blinded by the lights and the girl representing Olivia has left the room, it shows that Oliva left him to handle the hate and has blinded him out of nowhere with her version of the story of their relationship.  He is finally telling Olivia through this song that he figured it out and knows the secret she has been keeping. He is keeping silent for a reason. He doesn't want to be the type of person to put people down and ruin their reputation. He is playing the long game and will only expose that Oliva has a secret, but won't tell anyone what it is.",en

And since everyone was swooned by Olivia at the time and blaming everything on Josh, here in this lyric, he could be referring to how ""Good For You"" fooled everyone into thinking that Josh was completely okay after whatever might have happened in their relationship and that he was doing way better than Olivia was when in actual reality, I don't know about Olivia but Josh was in pain too.

655,"Ok so I have a theory. Hear me out...Olivia announced her relationship with a older guy and this song is about somebody cheating on Joshua. What if she was dating that older guy when Olivia was still underage or maybe it was a little ""crush"" and Joshua knew about it. So maybe Joshua is talking about how he knows that they were together when she was still underage (Olivia and the older guy) and that she cheated on him with the older guy and that Joshua will keep his mouth closed about it. What if Olivia cheating with an older guy is the Secret. Also Olivia never said that Joshua cheated, which she proves in her song Traitor. She sings ""Guess you didn't cheat but your still a traitor"" so technically the whole reason that Olivia wrote all those songs was because she was upset that he moved on so quickly. Joshua also says in his song Crisis that Olivia was the one who broke up with him in the first place, this gets me thinking that Joshua really didn't do anything wrong and it was Olivia all along who possibly cheated, broke up with Joshua, and made the whole world think he's this terrible person. Olivia was just mad that after she broke up with Joshua he moved on so easily which she explains in her song Good4u. Again this is just my take on this whole situation, lmk what yall think. Now I will leave you with these wonderful words of wisdom from Michael Scott, ""Oh how the turn tables"".",en

The secret could be his ex girlfriend's  new boyfriend (which isn't public when he finds out, but he hears about him from mutual friends). The lyrics ""I should have seen in coming then"" is a reference to the past when this new boyfriend's name came up when they were still a couple, but she told him it was only a crush. I dont think the video/song is showing someone cheating, but rather that his ex-girlfriend recently got together with someone that he was suspicious of while they were together...16 months ago when he first felt that way.",en

676,"I just realized that this basically means olivia was cheating. The part where he says “Your secrets safe with me, and him” the him part is likely referring to the guy she was cheating with. Especially because based off any songs from Joshua or olivia, they were falling out of love. Even at 1:23 where he says “you had me tricked for 16 months” you can see a girl in the back making out with a guy. I assume that the girl depicts olivia cheating and towards the end of the video is when he confronts her. I also think the reason he said “your secrets safe with me” is because he had remained silent even as olivia put their whole relationship status in public, he chose not to tell the full story. I’m not sure though, I have to go back to listen to Olivia’s songs to make more connections.",en

Olivia and Joshua broke up early 2020 and like Joshua said, he was with said girl for 16 months. Which would give him some time to grieve and then get with Sabrina once he was ready.
Also, the girl in the music video is blonde and resembles Sabrina a little bit.",en

1058,Y’all I don’t think he coming for Olivia in the song I think he’s coming for Sabrina!!!! The way it was filmed definitely is giving me “cry me a river” by Justin Timberlake vibes.  So basically Sabrina was playing up Ariana Grande songs “break up with your girlfriend” because this chick was bored but I got bored with him and was cheating on him too?  Crazy ,en
1059,I don't get it. Is he talking about Olivia ir Sabrina? I thought it was about Olivia but in the end was a girl exactly like Sabrina,en

1071,does everyoe not realize he’s no talking about olivia… it’s sabrina (i love both artists equally),en
1072,This song isn’t about Olivia since she didn’t cheat or go off with someone else. But he uses symbols about it. One he uses lots of things she used in her songs such as “good for u”. Two there was a part around 1:40 where he looks but his band is still showing how his fans didn’t support or help him when he got hated on. Another thing is the flashing lights at the end can mean lots of things. Paparazzi always asking questions about what he did or him getting hated on on the streets trying to tone them out. Also white cars can have something to do with it. This may not be about her and I can be wrong just pointing a few things out tho.,en

1090,"just gonna say, i’m just a casual listener. but these comments are SO gross. Joshua and Olivia have extremely toxic fanbases. Choosing sides, it’s so immature. You know NOTHING about their relationship. You don’t know them. You have no idea what happened to them and what their intentions were. People can exaggerate things when songwriting. Relationships aren’t always “good guy and bad guy”. Relationships are complicated. They can both be right and both be wrong AT THE SAME TIME. Stop acting like you know them personally and why they did what they did. You don’t. You only can guess. You don’t know the truth on either side.",en
