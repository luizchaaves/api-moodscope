275,"True story y‚Äôall: 

My ex and I left off on bad terms back in February (pre-COVID). Around September I dreamt that we ran into each other, sat alone and talked, then peacefully said goodbye. I wrote a letter of closure and mailed it mid-December only to find out it arrived days before her family moved. She got a hold of me on Christmas eve so that we could find healthy closure. We opened up, apologized, laughed, congratulated one another, reflected, prayed together, and said goodbye. Can‚Äôt lie when I say this song was playing in the back of my mind during our conversation but I finally found peace in letting go. I pray that whoever relates to this song finds peace in their search for closure. Trust me when I say you deserve it.",en

Forget about me, it's this I insist, addiction persists to hold me in the grips of its closed fist, what I've accomplished, is a very short list, the deeper I ascend the scary it gets. ",en
