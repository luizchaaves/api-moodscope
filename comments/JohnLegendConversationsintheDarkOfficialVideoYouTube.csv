I remember feeling this way for her and I kept trying to get her to stick with counseling and drop the weapons we wielded towards one another but she wouldn't/couldn't do it. Continue to communicate, even when it's difficult or painful. Don't stonewall. Always continue to do the little things for each other. Take an anger management class. Read The Five Love Languages together. Learn how your partner receives love and deliver it in their language, not yours. When you have children, plan a date night every week. I make those suggestions because they are areas where we failed. I've learned a great deal and I will be a much better husband sometime in the future.

In our modern world of hiding behind computers and apps, it being too easy for infidelity and sneaking around, being emotionally unavailable, people hide the feelings in their Hearts as they are too scared of rejection, and that they may actually be worthy of and find someone to share mutual true love with. Let's bring back the old days of being open and being steadfast in romantic relationships, and not just selecting another quick on-line date and moving on quickly instead of resolving issues.
