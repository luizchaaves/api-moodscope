5,"This video hits so hard. Especially the payoff at the end, like these people are using all of the cheesy symbolic methods I grew up around but using them in a way that feels earned instead of derivative. Watched this before the show and in this video alone you experience these characters enough to feel the tragedy at the end.",en

25,"I know this is a random song to relate to but i really do, even if it was made to tell the story of two fictional characters. The way i interpreted this song, it seems as if its highlights how quick people can turn on you. Just kinda reminds me of my life and all the times ive been made to feel bad just cos of tiny mistakes that ive made. People who i thought were there to support me but were so quick to give me a piece of their mind when things didn't go their way. ""Tell you you're the greatest"" as the eldest sibling my parents as well as siblings have high hopes for me, even my friends as well. Its like they all expect me to be this jolly talented person but once i make a mistake or even get angry, its war w them. There rlly is no winning here is there",en

30,One of the best music videos ever really good I have been a fan ever since they started,en
31,"When you decide to watch Arcane, series based on a game, you expect easter eggs,homage and referrence to the game, but instead you get a story with deep layered characters, world building/expanding, political ideals and conflict in moral values.

50,"A série arcane foi muito daora cara, continue com o trabalho! A introdução de arcane é uma que eu nunca skipei",pt
51,That moment when powder fires her finger gun and it does a quick flash to jinx is so sick.

I'm telling everyone who hasn't seen it yet to watch it and I'm awaiting impatiently for the 2nd season.

114,long time i love this song so much #imagine dragons,en
115,"Just wanted to comment this cuz I saw other ppl in the comments talk about it. Riot really made arcane realistically perfect, they really made the character's personalities realistic and everyone has a both good and a bad side. There's just some things in life that are meant to happen without a reason behind it or anyone that's blameable and riot really portrayed those moments in arcane perfectly. They made Jinx(or powder however u like it) likeable even tho she was completely messed up and same goes for vi and every other character. Damn even silco had his share of scenes in which he wasn't a complete dick. Even the villain of it all had a nice, fatherly side we could have been rooting for. So honestly, watching arcane was probably the best way I could have spent my free time. Thank you riot for the amazing job you've done.",en

129,finally JID needs this. He had always been fire. Give it to him,en
130,"I listen to this song very often and just tonight did I realized what the true meaning behind it. Apparently this is Powder reminiscing the memories she had with Vi. Explains why Vander is nowhere to be found in the bar. This is Powder's final moments before she embraces ""Jinx"". She felt alone and had to fend for herself ""Everybody wants to be my enemy"", she did what she had to do to survive. All this time I thought it was nothing more than music video.",en

A child raised in a crime infested society, with no real parental figure at all. And you can see her slow decay into madness as the song progresses. And how that trauma still affects her.

One, the video starts with Powder winding up her monkey which, if I remember correctly, is exactly how Get Jinxed starts. The callback is a very nice touch. The second thing I loved is the level of animation when Vi is showing how to throw a punch and the difference when Powder later tries to do the same thing. See, Vi's punches are blurs: her form is perfect and you can't even see her fists when she extends. In contrast, Powder is obviously very sloppy and you can see her arms every time she tries to punch. It may be a little thing, but I really liked the detail.",en

We never really know what life is like for the characters before the heist, and I think it adds a bit more to characterization Powder than just being a kid with attachment issues who wants to prove herself.

At 12 sec you could see that it's layered. It moves up and down in sync with her walk. Such details bring's fiction to life. I love it.,en
