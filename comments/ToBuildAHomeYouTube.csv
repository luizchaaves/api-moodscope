When I listen to her I have tears in my eyes, she makes me feel my heart, how strong and courageous I could be but sometimes I wonder if I have the courage to continue, life puts a lot on us test on our way. Sometimes I wonder but what have I done to deserve all of this in my life! And the last event I went through was the most for me, I was abused. I consider myself to be a good person, or at least I do everything to be one because I don't want to be like those who made me suffer, I am making a better world on my own scale. I have long asked myself the question, is there a reason for everything we experience, and today I don't have the answer, other than maturity I think. I turned to spirituality, thinking of finding an answer. Besides, it's astonishing but everything that I have lived has still made the person I am, has always wanted to help others, to be good with people, to have relationships of trust, to be generous and to have kindness and being hypersensitive, I had a lot of questioning. But sometimes I still have the urge to give up and let it all go. I write this comment with the heart, I send good waves and even if it is not easy you have the resources in you, the trials that you did not think you had overcome in the past you have overcome them say you that, you are strong and courageous.",en

I feel so lonely, I can’t sleep , i have a boyfriend who i love so much but the negatives are i have anxiety and that means out of nowhere i feel so stressed i start overthinking and he doesn’t know how to calm me down or be there for me.   And that bothers me because I don’t want to be so sensitive but i Am and in the end my boyfriend should know how to be there. I had a mental breakdown yesterday and he wasn’t there for me. I have no friends. 3 years with depression. I have a good God though with God i feel so safe and peaceful but when the devil steals my peace and happiness i go straight back to my depression. It is hard I’m used to this I want to feel free and happy i want to be understood by people.  I don’t want to keep explaining myself over again.
