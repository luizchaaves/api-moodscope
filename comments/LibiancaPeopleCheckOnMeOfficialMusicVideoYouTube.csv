One of my best friends for 8-9 years passed away due from suicide 2 years ago, but my other best friends and I just heard the news a few months after her passing. I felt terrible. I always have the sense of guilt of not being able to be a good friend to her by not checking up on her often. I was too busy with school, work, and family and not even have the chance to take care of myself and have a free-time of my own. Not only that, I am not a consistent friend because I would only talk or reply to people that talks to me first or texts me back, but I will always get back to them immediately or asap. Ever since I finally confirm and acknowledge the fact that she is gone from this world, I always cried on my bed, missing her and wishing to get back to where we were just young and free and just being kids and hanging out with each other and with our other best friends and then finally hours later, I go to sleep due to exhaustion from crying too much. Even typing this whole thing is bringing me to tears and having a huge regret. I wish I can turned back time and can change her fate and her life by just a text or a call every so often, ‚ÄúHey Gurl! I miss you! How are you?‚Äù",en

I don‚Äôt know what you are going through but maybe you think that things will never get better and you feel stuck but please don‚Äôt lose faith cause that‚Äôs the only thing that kept my alive. Tell yourself everyday that there is more: there is more than the pain and the suffering that you feel, start telling yourself a different story cause trust me you need to know that in all this darkness there must be a light and in the end it will all make sense. I wanna tell that I am proud of you and how much strong you are and no, I don‚Äôt have to know you to tell you so. Give everything to Jesus, pray. Sometimes tears are prayers too but please never doubt on him (I used to think ‚ÄúGod hates me, he forgot about me‚Äù but only now that I look back I can see that he was right there at the lowest point of my life).

644,"When I first heard this song it immediately brought me to tears. My older sister committed suicide 7 years ago and honestly I can‚Äôt believe it. That particular instance was her 2ND ATTEMPT. Her first attempt was right after she was violated by one of our uncles. I had no idea at the time, I just wanted to be there for her. Spent several days going back and forth to the hospital after her first attempt checking on her. She was so mad and took her anger out on me, the ONLY PERSON who came to see her. I didn‚Äôt find out what happened to her until AFTER she passed. I was struggling with depression and anxiety at the time of her first attempt too so I wasn‚Äôt strong enough to pull her out of that. I barely held on myself. Over the years her personality changed and anger took her over inside many times. Triangulation eventually caused us to stop talking a couple months before her second attempt. The narcissist in our lives completely turned her against me and one night she snapped on me over a REMOTE, and threw a glass cup at me while I was in bed with my son. My son could have gotten harmed so I had to separate myself. She had become dangerous for me to be around. Nevertheless I always hoped my sister would get better. I wasn‚Äôt there to notice the signs on her 2nd attempt. I had no idea she had gotten to that point again. I was devastated and completely shocked when I got the call that she had attempted to hurt herself by hanging and it left her brain dead. I absolutely couldn‚Äôt believe it. Now that I‚Äôve healed, I look back at that situation differently. The person I am now CAN see the signs and pull someone out of that IF THEY OPEN UP. One thing about my sister is that she NEVER opened up about what was bothering her to many people. She felt like she always had to be strong and she never set any boundaries for other people. She always bent over backwards to help EVERYONE, especially the narcissist in our life who just kept using her over and over again. Didn‚Äôt care about my sisters dreams and goals, just wanted to use her to run her business while she did whatever she wanted to do. My sister had a really good heart. The man who initially violated my sister is still free and probably violating other people. My family shamed ME for trying to get justice for my sister after I found out, they worked hard to keep it under the rug. Didn‚Äôt want to talk about it at all. That man was arrested last year for hurting someone else‚Äôs daughter and they STILL REFUSE TO HOLD HIM ACCOUNTABLE. I say all of this to say that I have been given so much ",en
