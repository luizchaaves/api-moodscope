To lose someone so loved by a lot of people worldwide, who spoke to them not many musicians can, to what might be suicide or at least mental health issues, is frightening. It's obvious that his amazing songwriting came from within, and spoke deeply and personally, which is why so many people connected with him and his music. Mental health is a serious issue and this is why mental health and mental health week needs to be addressed, it's not a taboo, people need people to talk to and to be listened by. For someone like Chris, with so many fans and so much love from around the globe, this speaks volumes as to how mental health can affect someone and it not be addressed or even noticed. RIP Chris, I was shocked when I read about your death yesterday morning. A serious talent and another master gone too soon, I really hope, if anything, this causes a reaction so people take mental health more seriously. Thank you Chris for speaking to me on a personal level, I too, have fallen on Black Days, but you were there to help me.

So much that I continued with my passion and dream of becoming a musician and a performer, and I recently graduated college with a bachelors degree in Popular Music and performance.

Tim Commerford is a joy, awesome bassist, love his tattoos and I always smile when I see him just bopping his head smiling. I love acoustic guitar and love that Chris wanted Audioslave to blend both acoustic and electric. Though at times the high pitch of Tom Morello's guitar can be a little harsh on my ear, there's no denying his  incredible talent. He's a joy to watch. Love how he flips his wrist at the end of his solo here. The video is so well done. The green and blue (bruising) effect I guess used to suggest abuse, has a calming effect on me. That old Spanish mansion both beautiful and somewhat creepy to me. I'm sure Jimi Hendrix's ghost was present ",en

As you do at a young age you meet your first quote on quote Love, I had no idea how fucked my mind was and still is!! All was good for the honeymoon period but about a year or so into the relationship my mental health started deteriorating and I couldn’t understand why? I’m only 22 years of age just now band most people say “you have just started your life” but they don’t know my life begun from the day I could walk! As a lot of people also experienced, I didn’t grow up knowing my dad. I still don’t know the bastard and still to this day I don’t think my mind has realized that I probably won’t ever get the chance?

People change and move on and there is a black, empty, hollow feeling where something different could have filled it. Then down the years when you think things could get better but you experience a pain that you never thought you could experience and everything comes crashing back down on you. And you have no idea what to do. You don’t know what to ask or say. You’re just alone to bask in this feeling.
