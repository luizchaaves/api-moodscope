Very underrated 'cause he created himself a wrong image for other people. When he will die, all of you will idolizing him, but will be too late. Exactly like Michael Jackson....Appreciate fantastic artists when they are alive...I mean Chirs and others that are fantastic...each of you by the preferences of his/her ego like or his/her soul. They need more respect, people like CB(Breeezy) are born once in a milion years believe me. In case you don't observe this, he is the successor of MJ his videoclips are during and are making in a very long time, exactlty like the videos of MJ, but for our times. He is the best dancer, in my opinion, of the entire World. MJ was his inspiration on his dance but wow....the recruit surpassed his master! He is for me the best of all time, is just my opinion! He is wow, I don't have enough words to describe him! R&B is his base but he do also rap, trap, pop, dance music...and other kind of music! In rap my favorite is Eminem, I like also 2pac, The Game, Lil Wayne...old school rappers! In our days mmmm no, no eventualy Roddy Ricch, G-eazy, and some other rappers! My favorite kind of music is rap and hip-hop and R&B but I listen any kind of music! I like also Jeremih, Drake is WOW, Tyga has a tiger flow:)) and is very charismatic...and other rappers, from old school of rap! T.I. the inventor of trap music! Have a good day, and don't forget to appreciate artists and your parents when they are alive, maybe one day will be too late! Peace and love from Romania! ",en

1006,"Guys the bible tells us more people go too hell than heaven if you live in sin and don't repent you won't be saved and god doesn't send people to hell if they go too hell they go of free choice! Hell was made for the devil and his angels you should watch billy garham give your life to Jesus we are in the last days and Jesus loves you and he shedded blood on that cross without the shedding of blood sin cannot be forgiven and sin is very serious in the eyes of god  I was depressed to and sinned for fun I had suicidal thoughts I remember in my room one night I told god that of things don't change I'm gonna kms I was sorry weak and at sometimes so weak I felt like I was dying then I remember a really good day came a day I loved so much and wanted more of so on that same day I remember saying god, I'm just gonna trust you and when you try to do something right the devil attacks you so the next day was horrible I don't wanna say how it was it was just horrible! I stayed strong BC after so long of trying to go to anything else but god they all failed me so I held on to god as the reason let me skip to now and say I started off faithless now I'm so faithful in god I started off worried for my future now I know its something gods gonna handle I'm not feeling depressed anymore the whole year of 2022 was hard but with god I made it threw! Now I learned so much and love my relationship with god I know he loves and cares for me AND HE LOVES AND CARES FOR YOU TOO! I remember I was depressed and believed god didn't love me or care for me but that what the devil telling me lies and I had so many demons but now its 2023 I'm free!",en
