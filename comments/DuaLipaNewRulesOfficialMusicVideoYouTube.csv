447,"I love taking the time to really listen to mother nature and just get away from busy stressful city life. I hope everyone in the chat finds their own inner peace. There's no way God meant for us to be working 9-5 for the rest of our lives. When you are not working I really hope you can relax and be one with nature. May you, your family and everyone you care about find and hold onto whatever inner peace you can find. Life is to short for BS let the small things go and really embrace your happiness cause everyone deserves happiness. Don't think about the past, stop thinking about the future just live in the moment right here right now everything is okay, embrace your happiness. You are on this earth for a reason whatever your purpose is find it and chase it. Be humble, be kind. Be loving, Never judge and Help as many people as you can a long the way. Spread the love you never know when someone you care about might pass away. Send that letter. Send that text, make that phone call. Let whoever you care about know that you love them. I'm talking men need to do this to. You can still be a manly man and still care for your bros. You don't have to pretend to be strong every second of the day. It's okay to lean on people who care for you. That's why their there. Life is extremely hard sometimes and it's perfectly fine to get things off your chest.  Its okay to cry and let things out. It's a human emotion. Just let things go and find peace. You are worth it everyone is here for a reason. It's okay to fail as long as you get back up FAIL means first attempt in learning. We are all human and humans make mistakes it's okay. 3 steps with any problem you have. 1. Identify that theres a problem. 2. Fix the problem. 3. Learn and grow from that problem and move on. Most important part is to move on and let it go. It's okay to be a kid sometimes. There are these rules that adults have to apparently follow the most boring rules screw that. Obviously be a adult but there's always a time and place for everything. Don't let other people stop you from living the life you want to live. Self control is strength. Calmness is mastery. You have to get to a point where your mood doesn't shift based on the insignificant actions of someone else. Don't allow others to control the direction of your life. Don't allow your emotions to over power your intelligence. Life is not meant to be serious. Go dance in the rain. Go make a Sunday with tons of whipped cream and sprinkles, go have a water gun fight, go to an arcade room, go make a house out of cards, go paint with your fingers, go play with mud get dirty, splash in all the puddles, go chase butterflies, sing loud and let people sing with you, go buy that toy you never got when you where a kid, make a fort out of blankets, eat breakfast for dinner, eat with your face with your kids see who can finish their food first, make funny faces. draw on the walls who cares you can paint it after read some comic books, make a comic book, take a massive bubble bath, sleep with stuffies, build Lego, have a Disney marathon. Listen to music YOU like to listen to. Point is do whatever you wanna do. Live YOUR life live YOUR movie, be awesome for YOU. Always be true to yourself and always always have good morals and values. Spread the joy. Spread the happiness and spread all the love you can. Everyday you go outside compliment someone. How do you feel when someone compliments you. EXACTLY it feels awesome. We don't stop playing because we grow old, we grow old because we stop playing. LIVE YOUR MOVIE!!! I love you all and have a beautiful peaceful sleep",en
