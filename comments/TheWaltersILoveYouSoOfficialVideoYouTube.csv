Our relationship was a secret because both our parents did not approve of dating, my parents found out and demanded we break up, I didn't break up and I stayed because I loved him so much. My relationship with my parents got progressively worse but I didn't care because he was there for me. In the summer break, he messaged me saying that he 'has to break up with me' because it's 'exhausting to hide things'. I saw him everyday in school. i watch him smile and laugh while I was dying inside and cried everyday. it's been over a year since we ended and I still cry over him. Even so, as much as it hurts to see that I meant nothing to him, I'm happy to see him happy. i pray for him to be happy everyday.",en

679,"Recently, I had a crush in the class next to me. She was my first ever crush. Everywhere I went all I could think about was her. She appeared in my dreams. Day before yesterday I told her about my crush on her in the library because my friends said it was the perfect time. She said no, which isn't suprising considering how ugly I am, but that wasn't the part that broke my heart. She said these exact words behind my back: ""look at how white I am, and how black he is. And look at how short he is. He's 1 year older than me but still shorter than me. How could he even dream of being my boyfriend!?"". After hearing these words It literally shattered my soul. I couldn't stop crying. Fortunately no one noticed my crying because I was in the back. But in my bus room people noticed I looked EXTREMELY sad, as I am a very happy warm-hearted person. I told them it was nothing but they insisted something was wrong, even in the bus I cried and people noticed. They asked me what it was but I never told them. It's been 2 days the memory flashed in my dreams and I can't stop thinking about it.",en
