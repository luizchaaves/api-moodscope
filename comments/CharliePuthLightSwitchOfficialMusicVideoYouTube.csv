The man is a legend. With that being said, every SINGLE that Charlie has released since 2015 were hits, as it should. Charlie never had a ""fallen off."" He just wasn't releasing any singles to promote. He isn't just a few-hits wonder... If he was releasing official album singles from 2019-2021, then he would've without a doubt been topping the charts just like he did with his ""Voicenotes"" and ""Nine Track Mind"" singles.
