300,"Comments are not given by the Account holder:
Some of the song lyrics  are relatable to all people, at some time in their lives.  
The lyrics state the subject matter of the song, without leaving any room for doubt or assumption. It's really no different than if the song was sung by female and the video was exactly the same, except they  are male and female, people would think very differently about it. Although I think it should be age-restricted, due to it's content and the impression that it could leave on children and other people, like those with physical and/or mental developmental disabilities, since some parents, guardians, and caregivers do not give their full attention to the content of most all of the videos on this site and other sites like this. To be frank, all videos with this type of content, along with other types of content, like violence, should have age restrictions, regardless of whether it's a male and female, 2 (or more) males, or 2 (or more) females. It should all have, if no age restrictions, than higher ratings, and it should always have explicit warnings in front of it.",en
