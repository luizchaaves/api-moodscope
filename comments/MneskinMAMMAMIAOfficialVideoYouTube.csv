Already a satirical song about the drug accusations at Eurovision, the music video is a parody of the literal (egotistical) meaning of the lyrics (‚Äòwhy am I so hot‚Äô ) countered by the slightly comedic slasher genre as Damiano is slaughtered by his band mates. I think they knew some people would misread the irony and instead judge them harshly, especially those who think this song is IWBYS #2 (which it isn‚Äôt) and I think the film makes fun of that stereotyped interpretation of them.

But smoking is becoming obsolete these days though that imagery is part of co√∂pting that ‚Äúrockstar aura‚Äù‚Äîif you don‚Äôt smoke are you even really a tortured artist? Their music/lyrics for Supermodel addresses something like the concept of nodels/wannabes putting on a front but their attitude about cigs (Damiano claiming he can‚Äôt go 2.5 hours without one) is no different. So many ‚Äúartists‚Äù these days act as though being emotionally dependent on their cig/vape is a personality trait (self-imposed oral fixation as compulsive addiction, I suppose). It‚Äôs true in social situations it‚Äôs a nice way to find an excuse to walk outside & meet fellow smokers. It feels special. You‚Äôre the outcasts or whatever. You‚Äôre above the social situation you placed yourself in and anyone else not smoking. Smoking was a way for people to connect by disconnecting, it is special in that way. Tribal aboriginal cultures have been smoking all kinds of things for these reasons. But it became obsolete when greedy unethical multinational companies added nicotine (something an aboriginal tribe would never smoke) & concerns over the environment became more real‚Ä¶smoking doesn‚Äôt look as ‚Äúcool‚Äù as it did when people were allowed to smoke indoors & it was a big part of culture. I view smokers as more insecure, lost, overly self-conscious, avoidance types (avoidance with dealing with all manners of things including the present moment they‚Äôre delaying with the sensation of a cig); types who fall easily into a social fold & have no authentic inner guidance/easily influenced (their circle smokes so they smoke). People think it looks cool or editorial because it‚Äôs just mirroring some bygone era of Hollywood silver screens or whatever glamorization of it. But really it just looks exactly like that‚Ä¶like you‚Äôre trying to seem cool by doing what cool people used to do. Relying on that old imagery & calling it up as a reference/shortcut to seeming cool. How original, no? It‚Äôs very monkey see monkey do. Anyway, nice Phillip Morris product placement, you tortured artists you.",en
