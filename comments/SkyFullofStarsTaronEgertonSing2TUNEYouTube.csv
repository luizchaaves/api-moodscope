0,I love how in animated movies or shows the singing and dancing is never cringy it’s just nice,en
1,I love that they brought Johnny's dad back and he's super supportive and loving towards his son.,en
2,Johnny absolutely nails every song this was my favorite scene in the move because he sang great as usual and stood up to klaus. This movie was way better than the first in my opinion,en
3,2:50 gives me goosebumps everytime.,en
4,"The acapella part was my favorite part of this whole scene, you can hear the passion in his voice",en
5,"At 2:34, the backup he received from everyone made me tear up and smile, I swear. And the way his voice just had that visceral sound of emotion and anger at 2:49 was just…muah One of my favorite parts",en
6,"It's heartwarming to see Klaus smiling at Johnny for once, he understood that he's a clever person and he deserves Klaus' respect",en
7,"I get goosebumps every time it gets to round 2 in this scene; the way he starts yelling/singing the best part of the lyrics is powerful. “I don’t care, go on and tear me apart! And I don’t care if you do!”",en
8,It's extremely rare that an animated sequel outdoes the original. This movie was the exception!,en
9,That finale part with the drums is possibly the most perfect piece of improv ever,en
10,Goosebumps litteral goosebumps. I can never get over how Johnny makes the song like 2 times better,en

15,"Johnny is literally one of the best characters in Sing. He truly has found his voice and his calling. Both with very powerful songs that fit him. First it was I’m Still Standing, and now Sky Full Of Stars.",en
16,"Johnny easily has the best song in the film. It’s not just a matter of how great the singing and dance work is, but like porshas (even though I don’t think hers was developed as highly leading up to it), it’s not just a song about “sky’s in the stars” or whatever. You can legit tell it has a double meaning to everything with the hardships and everything he’s going through, especially when the dance instructor pops in to put him down again.",en
17,Me listening to this at least 5 times a day. The pure soul in his voice moves me everytime,en
18,Jonny not only shows you how to sing from the heart but also that no matter what happens You should never give up.,en
