148,"You know what I love about this song? It's that the song is sang in Abel's point of view. And what I mean by that is the lyrics try to tell the story that he's in control... that he's the badass... that he can call the girl at any time and make her leave her lover for him... when in reality, he's the one writing the song about her. He's the one giving her the time of day. He's the one thinking about her. And, as shown in the music video, he's the one pinned down to the chair. While he tries to play it off as being the one in the driver's seat, it's in fact the exact opposite. She's in control here. She's the one clouding his thoughts. She's the one that caused him to practice this toxic masculinity. She's the flame and he's the moth. This hits way too close to home for me. She's the flame, I'm the moth... even though I refuse to believe it.",en
