1024,"Hello . Please do not ignore this message that God sent me to tell you today. You may be like ""Even if I want to listen to this sh#t, I'm too far gone, God won't bother with me and I don't need to waste my time when I have better things to do"" then you go back to your worldly desires, things that seem pleasurable but only give you temporary satisfaction. Trust me it's really hard to let go of these things. But giving up these acts, especially concerning sexual immorality, drinking and the likes will give you true peace of mind. I don't know what you have been through, what you have or have not done, or what you may be going through right now, but God has sent me to tell you that it is not too late to repent of your sins and ask God to take care or your burdens and temptations. He will make things easier for you as you hand your life over to Him. Please do not wait for the 'right time' to repent, because Jesus  can return any time to take his people.Yes Jesus who died for our sins to give us eternal life. He is the only way to make heaven. He loves you and cares for you deeply, no matter what  you may have done to hurt Him, as long as you go back to Him with sincerity of your heart, He will make everything easier for you. God bless you",en
