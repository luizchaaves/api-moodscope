316,"I have a theory.

She knew this would be the beginning of SOS, because it hints to it so much in this video and in the shirt video. Here, we see her in this mound, she's battling her soul, battling the control she has. Also we can notice that the video takes place in a nature setting, which is a big theme for Ctrl, but a lot of the videos for the Ctrl have very dark lighting, contrary to this video. She leaves the mound, un-grounding herself and letting all control go. She finally falls asleep and her soul rises. I think that the soul went into the next era, of silence. Nothing. Then in the shirt video we see her soul rise again, this time we see it transport to SZA. Solana is gone, left in the forest of Ctrl and SZA has taken over, deploying all missiles.",en
