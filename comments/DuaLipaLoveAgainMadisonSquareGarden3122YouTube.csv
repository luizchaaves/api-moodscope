12,"lots of backtrack, chorus and playback sounds, you can see this easly specially comparing the sound of diferent performances of the same tour...But of course there's also real voice in the show. As a show is very good and so entertaining production, but simply I don't like that amount of playback, I believe she dont have good voice for STADIUMS, is a soft voice. She is a very good singer that sounds great at small theatres. (and I'm not detracting the fact that she have better presence than ever and in a unique way because she is powerful and still sweet at the same time.",en
