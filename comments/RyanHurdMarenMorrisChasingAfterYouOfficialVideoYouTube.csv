274,This is one of those songs that just brings a friendly reminding message that all good relationships take work. Bonding and connecting and harmony and affection and peace and boundaries and warmth that all takes proper work and the only motive that even makes it all work is Love. Love is the motive to good relationships. Two souls having the desire and capacity to complement the other in the healthiest way possible through ups and downs blood sweat and tears hunger and full bellies thirst and hydration sorrow and joy they run and swim and fly together the rest of their lives forever bc they choose to love one another for who they are forever. They go through everything together. She sings “something about you makes me believe we can make it” she feels his soul that his soul complements rather than conflicts hers. They decide to put in the work to their relationship that’s why they keep coming back together bc they love one another. I was thinking about my beloved man in my life while in the store hearing this song. I was like oh my that sounds so much like us what we been through. Yes we keep coming back to the love that’s there. That always was since the beginning. Takes time and work to be in a right relationship,en

683,"Growing up l realized that mainstream country, with a few notable exceptions, didn't write it's own music but that didn't matter because by the middle 70's there was Dylan and the Beatles and the Stones and the Beach Boys and the Who revitalizing music with their own material.  There were the Monkees and endless manufactured Boy Bands and God awful American Idol but great bands with original songs still flourished. And then Grunge came along and was balanced by BritPop but the music still came from the artists. Feels Like Teen Spirit on one side and Common People on the other.  Singers still break through with their own stuff but it's too often one hit wonders with sappy romantic lyrics and power ballads.  Where are the great bands?  The last ""original"" band that impressed me was The Killers.  I probably listen to a 1,000 songs a year but I don't hear many artists who consistently produce great material over years not months.  Where are the Billy Joel's, Joni Mitchell's, Brandon Flowers? The industry thoroughly corrupted Kelley Clarkson. I am missing something here.  And am willing to be educated.  Until then I seek solace in the 2,000 songs written by Rhett Miller. Excuse the purging and the typos.",en
