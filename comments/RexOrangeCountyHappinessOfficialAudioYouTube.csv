4,"I fell in love with someone who already has a boyfriend. Every night  i'd write poems about her. About my feelings for her that I cannot ever tell her. I fell for her because we are always one and the same. Like how we understand each other so much. How it was so easy that she slid into my heart. Every night we'll have deep conversations about life. And sometimes she'd tell me that she was not being happy with what's happening with her current relationship. And from that moment on,  I felt that she is just the one. I know it in my heart. She's the only girl that I can truly say I'd want to marry. And now, this song is my wish. That hopefully, when things become right for us, I will be the one. Even if i have to wait for very long, even if I have to battle the sadness every night, even If everyone tells me im being stupid, i will be the one. I will be the one that will propose to you, my dear. And even if I have to endure when things get so rough, I will. This is how much I love you. And no matter what happens, I will never forget you. Because you are my forever Happiness. ",en

To you, if you would be able read this, I want you to know... In that very short moment that we were able to spend time with each other... You mattered a lot to me. We may didn’t get the chance to be w/ each other but I will never forget how your existence brought me life. I will never forget how your smile lighted up my gray world. I will never forget how your your laugh seemed genuine whenever you'll see me or whenever I'll try to make you laugh. I will never forget how you called me in your own, unique way cause no one ever called me in my second name except you. I will never forget how your voice raises whenever you're telling me how tiring your day was and I will never forget how that frustrated voice goes gentle when it's my turn to tell how my day went.  I will never forget how your brows comes up and down whenever we run out of topic and got nothing to say. I will never forget how you encouraged and made me believe that I can do things I doubted I'd succeed. I was looking for something the same as what you exactly gave. The rest, but in a person. You just made me feel alive again. You just gave me air when I was barely breathing. You made me the happiest by just simply spending time with me. But there was also that one special night that captured my soul the most. When you sang this song to me. You were kinda whispering every single lyrics of this song straight to my ears, while your little husky voice perfectly blends with it. I was just staring and listening to you that time while engraving that moment in my heart. It was the sweetest feeling I had ever felt, yet the most scary too cause I fear if the time comes that we stop doing it, If you disappear and start doing this with someone you can actually be with, I know it'll leave me breathless. I know it'll be hard for me to forget. I know how that moment I engraved will leave scars in my heart. ",en

Hey you, my past paramour.  I still miss you. It's been 7 months ig when we first started talking with each other, how funny or maybe I can say how fool I am when I easily get attached with you. I didn't expect myself being like this rn. If only you could see me crying in my room at around 3 AM and the main reason is the idea of you leaving me broken and confused. I know that  Goodbye is the hardest thing especially when goodbye isn't what you want. But anyways this song keeps reminding me of you and of how precious you are but maybe we can't really be together because of some serious reasons. I have never wanted our relationship to die.I'm still happy tho even if I'm not your first but Ik to myself that I did everything just to make you feel loved  even though you keep on hurting my feelings for how many times. I'm wishing you genuine happiness in life and I hope that you'll be able to surpass those deep thoughts bothering you all the time. I'm leaving this comment just to express what I'm feeling rn, I don't even know why  I ended up like this, I'm also wondering if you're okay now or there's someone new, I'm still happy for you. I hope that you still remember the time when I told you that I won't forget your existence and yes I fucking did. I'm sure you're busy now so I won't bother you anymore. It's the last month of the year and I'm ending this year broken and haunted by your memories. Thank you for all the reciprocated efforts. I can’t help but smile at the memory. thank you for the times that you've been my inspiration for a short period of time. Be happy and I hope that you're not hurting anymore. I loved you.",en

You know why this month is more painful than the previous month? yes because this month I got the biggest disappointment and my emotions were at the highest peak, I fell in the lowest lowest point of the darkness. it really hurts when I really sincerely love and love you even I don't think about any of your weaknesses and strengths because I love you from all the sides you have, I love you as you are and I want to accompany you forever but it's a shame his heart can't see all this. whereas you happily boast about your new lover even by posting his face on his WhatsApp story. you know? it hurts a lot, I envy you can boast of him ""obviously"" even to the point of being posted, you've even called and even gave your own photo, while with me? nothing. I've never asked you to take a photo. You reject it on the grounds that you're anti-camera. I am also very disappointed, disappointed in myself who is stupid and stupid like this and I am also very disappointed in you because all your words cannot be trusted. Have you ever said that you are not good enough for me and I deserve more? If so, why do you deserve him? where's the truth! you were disappointed and left me because i broke my promise not to find someone, yes i was wrong but i made a promise when i was at his location and why did i find him? , of course I want to know the truth I want to know why you are like that and I also want to deal with it, and if you don't want it all to happen why don't you tell me directly? as if looking for the right time to leave me. and yes you said that the wound I gave was insanely painful didn't you? please I don't know what and where else the crime I did because at that time I just said my heart if I really sincerely love you what is wrong?. I'm also surprised at your feelings on the one hand, he says he's not loyal, he's not good either, he's made you disappointed, then why can't you just leave, you're still proud of it? whereas you easily leave me even though we both make you disappointed. I know the logic of the answer because physically I am different from him, yes he is handsome so it is very difficult to forget even when he makes a fatal mistake, why? ""because he's handsome"", then you say if you don't love him then why do you post a photo of him that you are proud of that he is the first person you look for when you are not okay with the reason that you ""miss"" him? it's love stupid name. I'm stressed, I know I'm a dick, especially when I think that you used to be close to me because I was sad and only appreciated the things I've done, right? idk wkwkwk. I just hope your heart is open and you see how sincere and loyal my love is, you bastard because I really love you. oh yeah honestly I'm so disappointed that I lost respect I hate you but I also love you. all i hope for is happiness for you because that is the only way i love you even though your happiness is not with me at least you get someone who is close to ""perfect"" according to your wishes because what you said about a ""faithful partner"" God has shown it's only you who refuse so so May you be happy and lasting until you reach your destination. and the thing about me, why am I so broken sick stressed sad disappointed emotional depression it's all me",en
