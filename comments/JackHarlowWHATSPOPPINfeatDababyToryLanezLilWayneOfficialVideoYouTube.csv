0,There isn’t a single bad bar in this song. They all killed the beat,en
1,What I love most is the respect Wayne pays to Jack by incorporating some of his bars from the original and putting his twist on it. That was such a huge knod and stamp of approval from the GOAT. I bet Jack was on cloud 9 with this one. Everyone understood the assignment.,en
2,I've always loved how Wayne takes lyrics from the original and makes them his own while maintaining Jack's original flow. He really spun that song into his own and it's awesome to hear.,en
3,I kept playing this track on repeat for months… every dude in the song did justice to their parts.,en
