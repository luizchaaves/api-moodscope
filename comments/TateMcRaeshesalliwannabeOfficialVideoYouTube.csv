2,"I love how near the end they kept showing up-close how the other girl is also struggling and exhausted. Like yeah, the girl you're jealous of, she's human too. She gets tired of all the pressure just like you. And the ending was perfect Ô∏è",en
3,"Tate is so underated, her voice is so unique, she's so young, and she literally can't write a single bad song!",en
4,I like the meaning. It doesn't push a generic stereotype of beauty but instead makes a remark at how this new girl is everything her SO is attracted to. I think everyone out there has a unique type but tends not to be with the person they idealise physically. So the song makes quite a vivid depiction of someone who's dating a partner that doesn't see them as their ideal SO appearance-wise; and as such she's getting caught up on it and feels inferior.,en
5,"I love it when tate and the ""perfect"" girl started dancing and have their first interaction with each other, tate started smiling as if realizing that the girl she envied is actually a good & fun person. they even started having fun together they also realize they both are not very different and had lots of similar interests (they both love dancing). Until both of them were disqualified from the ""competition"" meaning tate lost her insecurity and stop feel threatened to continue competing with the ""perfect"" girl. in the end, they even become friends.",en

10,Can't imagine how nostalgic it will be to come back and listen to this song in ten years. ,en
11,"The way she sings ‚Äúyou say she‚Äôs nothing to worry about, then why did you close your eyes when you said it out loud‚Äù is actually heartbreaking; you can tell the actual concern she had for the guy. Yeah she is jealous and insecure which is what the song is mainly about but she is also concerned for the guy. You can also hear the  sadness turn to anger then into confidence through out the song.",en

43,"The fact that the ""it girl"" is not a white mean blue-eyed blondie like all stereotypical it girls is genuinely so refreshing.

Most of the comments hit the nail on the head + I'm not big on music videos but I love this one and I can't stop watching it. I also just want to say my favorite part is the end.

Also, like that it's Clean so I can play for/share with people, unlike some others.",en
72,"I like how the ""mean girl"" isn't actually mean, it's Tate's character's wariness making her seem mean.

Also the bit at the end where neither of them win is so clever, it's like they're competing for the boy (the audition) at first and they end up smiling at each other and running out together because they realized it's silly to be so competitive with each other when they could support each other instead.",en

1056,"Imagine, if you died right now, where would your soul go for eternity? Was everything you ever did without purpose, and never really mattered, or will you just stop existing, after you draw your last breath? Think about this, it is the most important question of your life. There is only one chance to get it right, and it is in this lifetime. Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. Heaven is real, place of eternal bliss and perfection. Hell is real, place of eternal suffering and torment. You‚Äôre going to spend your eternity in one of those places. God's will is, that nobody would perish. One day, each and every one of us must appear before the Judgement Seat of the Holy Righteous God, and to give an account, how we have lived our life. The only way to get to Heaven is, if you‚Äôve never broken any part of God‚Äôs Law, in other words, if you‚Äôre without sin, and every single one of us have sinned. Not one person, who‚Äôs not born again from above, of the Holy Spirit, and is still in their sins, can inherit the Kingdom of God, for the wages of sin is death, and eternal damnation. Our sins separates us from God. That is why God in His love and mercy sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to atone for our sins. He left Heaven‚Äôs Throne, was God in flesh, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of a virgin, lived a holy perfect life while being in same temptations as we are, yet without sin, was condemned unjustly to death, although being innocent, was beaten, mocked, flogged, and crucified on the cross, and gave up His life and Blood willingly on our behalf, for there is no forgiveness of sins without the shedding of blood, but Christ, the spotless and unblemished Lamb of God, the Perfect Sacrifice once and for all, took the punishment of our sins on the cross, sacrificed Himself for us and paid the sin debt in full, past, present, and future, so we can be forgiven of all our sins, and be redeemed back to God, after the fall in Paradise by satan's tempting, through the Holy Precious Blood, which Jesus shed on the middle cross at Calvary, in His everlasting love towards every single one of us.",en
