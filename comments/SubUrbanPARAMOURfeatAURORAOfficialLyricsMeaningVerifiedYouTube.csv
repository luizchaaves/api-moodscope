0,"""Like a cloud holding a knife"" -  Aurora's personality resume",en
1,They are like long lost siblings but one joined the evil side and the other is a whole garden fairy,en
2,Can we just talk about how aesthetically pleasing their voices are ,en
3,"damn, Aurora's voice sounded exactly like in the studio version, such a talented person",en
4,"""like a cloud holding a knife"" she's so poetic. I didn't know being ""poetic"" was a personality trait, maybe it's not",en
5,"Aurora: ""A think they're very nice together""
Sub: ""Yah""
Aurora: ""Like a cloud holding a knife """,en
6,These two are the most beautiful weird and unique artists I’ve ever seen/heard they are like from another planet,en
7,It’s impossible to not adore Aurora ,en
8,Aurora is a greek nymph and Sub Urban seems like a majestic centaur,en
9,"I love how they explain all the situations in which they thought to make the song, how they turned the matter around and how they took care of the words, the phonetics, the ""taste"" (how aurora explain) and stuff",en
10,"Aurora is that one friend that it's really awkward to go out and hang out with, but you also lowkey have the best moments with them, have the deep conversations and feelings that you're gonna remember forever",en
11,Sub Urban's singing voice is really different from his normal speaking voice. Both are beautiful. Aurora's vocals blend with that voice and makes this a masterpiece! Both music wise and meaning wise this is amazing.,en
12,"I find it funny that Sub Urban's regular talking voice is somewhat strong while his singing voice is ""weak"" in the sense that it's not harsh or loud. Aurora's voice is the opposite, where her regular voice is weak and singing voice is strong. These two balance out very well",en
13,This man is a vampire and I am now interested. His talking voice??? Compared to his singing voice?!?? I wasn’t expecting it!,en
14,"That vocal technique that Sub actually does around @4:12 is really interesting. It's like a ""self-canon"", like he split his voice in two where one voice is doing a little melody and the other is whispering. Really interesting. Great interview. My God they're both so talented and deep-thinking. It's very refreshing.",en
15,"Aurora's voice is magical and beautiful, it is also amazing how she adapted to the Suburban style",en
16,"Love both of these guys. Every time Aurora explains her lyrics, it makes tears well in my eyes. She gets it, man. And Sub Urban's own lyrics, voice, and complicated, layered, haunting music production is just chef's kiss Such a beautiful duo.",en
17,"I love the fact that aurora was like ️
And suburban is ️️️️
If yk wht I mean idk how to say it",en
18,How is it that they both have such pleasing singing AND speaking voices?,en
19,"I've known AURORA for years and I can confirm she's not comfortable with collabs. Sub Urban, on the other hand, has very unique style (I always wanted to see a new genre called ""Sub Urban"" in honor of him). So for me their unique style make them a perfect match!",en
20,"That is one of the most calm and aesthetically pleasing interviews, they're voices are amazing",en
21,"Aurora is like wine, she gets better with time ",en
22,"This song hits close to home, especially culturally speaking as this is a reality faced by many Indians discovering love and sexuality for the first time. It's a beautiful awakening but quite often misunderstood or perceived differently by parents who, loving as they may be (or not be in certain cases), are products of a different generation. The impact that can have on their children's growth, maturity and self perception is huge. And while that concern may come from a place of love, it's still a fine line between ""concern"" and ""control"". This song captures that struggle and the aftershocks it can carry into a relationship perfectly.",en
23,"Wow I didn't imagine Sub Urban's voice to be that deep! They're so cute! I love both of them dearly, so I screamed when I found out they collabed! They're so special and lovely, I'm glad I discovered them both. They will always be my little happy corner <33",en
24,"Don’t you think they both matches each other energy beautifully?
I love how Sub distorts his voice. Also how sad is the story behind the song :(",en
25,"I started crying reading this. I enjoyed the song but had no idea what it was about. My first and only relationship so far in my life was damaged by parents just like these. I was damaged and still suffer every day, spending my time and energy problem-solving and working through it. To give you an idea of how it was in my relationship - my parents didn't know about him until after they kicked me out, but I'm sure they had a hunch and it played into telling me to leave. They felt like they were losing control perhaps. I was fearful of holding his hand because I felt so much shame in having to lie about being with someone to parents that I loved deeply, even though I knew lying to them about being with him was justified because he was such a wonderful person. But even after they met him, my shame never stopped. It continued and poisoned my relationship. I'm not with him anymore but I'm still trying to find the antidote. For the him and her in this song, and for the him and I - I feel badly for all of us for being given such a hard time in just wanting to be human. And to anyone who can relate - I'm so sorry. I'm sorry you had to go through that, or that you are going through it. But we have to keep hoping, and healing and remembering that yes, all we want to do is live and we, like everyone else, absolutely deserve to do that.",en
26,"no but aurora always takes my breath away like she's such a beautiful 
human being I can't ",en
27,She sings so well so effortlessly,en

45,Man I love Aurora. She's an angel,en
46,"I can relate so much to the lyrics, especially to ""in our house, the quiet is so loud"" and ""I can't hear a single word you wanna shout"" - that perfectly describes my relationship to my father somehow. But my interpretation for ""oh God, you're just a child"" is completely different. I see myself years ago when I was a child and my father was shouting at me and I thought ""oh God, I'm just a child, why do you do these things to me, please just let me be a child and have a childhood""",en
47,The song's a bop. Didn't expect these two to be so articulate and so insightful with their approach on the lyrics! Makes me love the song even more!!!,en

53,"I love Aurora and recently started listening to more Sub Urban. When I saw this collab, I was excited mostly over Aurora, but I fell in love with both of their roles in the song. Now listening to both of them here and how they worked together so well and on point, I would love more of these two together.",en
54,I really liked the lyrics since day 1 but watching them explain the whole song makes me love it even more. I know many people have experienced abuse in their households when they were young so getting to hear an entire song about that it's amazing.,en
55,Watching her on an interview it reminds me why im busting my butt at a crappy job to afford the plane ticket to go see her in concert! She truly  is goals <3,en
56,These lyrics are so thought provoking and making me look at what I can learn from them as a parent of a teenager. I hope I never stifle their live for the beauty and joys of the world by shaming them or using my interpretation of the moment to be formed by what society will say.,en

69,It’s so cool how low and grounded his voice is when he talks and then how breathy and how lifted he sings- it’s angelic,en
70,"This song's meaning hit right right at home a little too hard, especially when I had gotten pregnant. So much stress and expectations falling on my like weights that only got worse when I finally told my dad I wanted to move in with my boyfriend and raise the baby with him. ""What about us? What about opportunities here? Do you have any idea what you are getting yourself into? It's not all sunshine and rainbows! Do you understand anything? You have to live with this now"" My dad, without really knowing it, was mentally and emotionally abusive and that's what landed me in a mental hospital away from my newborn was all of that finally crashing on me all at once. My dad does try to help do what he thinks is best for me, he truly does care, but his methods got more and more corruptible and more like guilt tripping rather than actually teaching me and it very nearly almost got to the point where I actually had to cut him out of my life entirely with no interaction whatsoever if I was going to actually get better and think for myself. This song means a lot.",en

Much worse is when they trying to keep you in and on strict chains. When they're giving you freedom (even if it's freedom from things you had) you at least have chance to try something to build what you like - but when they just lock you in (and also take your phone and prohibit any outside communication) - then your chances to try are way limited. And, sadly, that's not a rare ocasion with highly religious (in a bad way) people. They usually prefer to try to cut the pieces of you they don't like, but not to set you free.",en

They develop multiple personality disorder after the father pressures them into acting like a boy. The personality that developed was a very negative boy. The father treats the male personality like it's the original and demands that they don't act like a girl ever again or they will be disowned. So the resentful male personality is given control and the true female personality is pushed and locked deep inside them. She tries to be positive internally but he gets more twisted and stressed from acting like something they aren't. The male personality was forced into existence from stress and now that they are in control they become darker and more resentful of the father.",en
