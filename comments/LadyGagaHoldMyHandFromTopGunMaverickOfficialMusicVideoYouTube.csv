625,"My husband and I watched Top Gun together. When we were about 30 seconds into this song I realized that I was experiencing a special moment in time.  I had heard of Lady Gaga but didn‚Äôt know it was her singing until the final credits rolled.  I wouldn‚Äôt have recognized her voice.  I don‚Äôt listen to secular pop music much. It was the words of the song, a declaration of commitment that one person can have for another, to be with them to the end through thick and thin is what the movie is about and its something that we should all aspire to in life, in our marriages and in our friendships, etc. Powerful treasure of a song! and beautifully performed by Lady Gaga.",en
