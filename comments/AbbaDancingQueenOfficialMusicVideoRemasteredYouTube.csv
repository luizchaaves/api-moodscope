I'm 21 and this is one of my favourite songs ever. Reminds me on the times when songs had a message and a real meaning and also had a positive vibes. Those were the days when all music stars needed a real talent and charisma to reach big success. In the era before Internet, MTV and social media, they needed to perform on the tours and concerts, which means they had to take a long time and a lot of hard work to reach high masses and selling album recordings to the music consumers. Nowadays everything is replaced with Internet, social media and streaming, so people don't need an actual talent to be famous and successful, they just need to do some stuff on Tiktok or be extra rich and they have a millions of followers on social media sites. Music industry today is a greedy corporate business and threats consumers like cash cows. That's why most of today's music sounds awful and crappy. After a few years, I think it will be forgotten because almost every single song sounds the same. I think the main reason is most of artists have the same producers and songwriters which don't really care about quality and value of music. Most of mainstream artists today have a very little charisma or they're afraid to take the balls and show their pure talent. And they sound awful in live concerts because they use too much autotune in songs, so they sound like robots. ",en

Although we were only with him for a year, we liked him, he was the school's first coach and im proud to be one of his students. Sadly, he died after the year and we got a new coach, by this time I was 9, and yeah, he was nice but just didn't have the same energy as our old coach. Turns out he wasn't really a coach. He was just a person who was really good in dancing and music you know, the band stuff. He scammed our school and basically stole the money that was supposed to be for our costumes. Long story short, I quit the band after that and this song gives me memories of our first coach.",en
