264,"Essa M√∫sica √© meu tema de 2023. J√° gostava de The Weeknd, mas agora com Blinding Lights se superou. 
N√£o sei se algu√©m observou os elementos de manipula√ß√£o narcisista durante o clipe. A partir dos 2 min a mulher manipula ele como se fosse marionete at√© o palco. Quando ele vai beijar ela, as luzes fazem ele descobrir a verdadeira face da mulher. E no final vem a desvaloriza√ß√£o e o descarte representado pelos caras que batem nele. Assim ele foge do lugar. No final a mulher fala: Touch! E ele fica sorrindo. Pq ele sabe que n√£o passava de uma personagem. Esse Clipe √© uma obra de arte da psicologia e cheio de s√≠mbolos.",pt

I do believe this song being the #1 song of all time [arguably, of course] is a statement, an attestation really, that we needed 'something different'.
