the eggs are there because clowns paint their makeups on them, it's a way for them to register their personal makeup so that no one copies it. Dua is the only person in the video without clown makeup, so the white egg represents her. She's resisting to fall in love again, just as the egg is resisting to be catched by the clowns.
