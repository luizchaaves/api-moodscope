My only issue is that it's too short, when she sang the chorus the first time and the ""Exceptional"" part came, I wish it had been a little longer. The second time for the chorus, it would have been really interesting if she started belting the ""treat me"" part, you know... using her FULL voice, cause we know it's there, she just be holding back sometimes.  But regardless, she's a growing artist and mf talented one too, I can't wait to hear her future projects. ",en

530,"As someone who was repeatedly SA in the most modest of clothes as I got older I've found solace and confidence in getting dolled up and wearing sexy clothes or ‚Äúshowing my skin‚Äù. Yet I still haven't gained the confidence to step out in front of people wearing what I want in fear of being made fun of or being subjected to cruel acts again just in a different light. And as a black woman I'm judged and critiqued to be better because I represent something but I just wanna represent myself at the end of the day. Throughout history black women haven‚Äôt gotten the love we deserve like other people and if we ever find good love and confidence it‚Äôs in ourselves through trial and error and I believe that's what a lot of these black women artist and performers are involuntary saying ‚ÄúI'm showing myself without caring what anyone thinks of me and if it gets money in my pocket while doing it so be it.‚Äù It‚Äôs like why should I cover up because someone I‚Äôm acquainted with or not doesn't like it. I know I look good and that I‚Äôm sexy and I‚Äôm gonna show it and it's just my perspective but that‚Äôs how I see this video and other sexualized videos from other black women artists and performers. From mercy to treat me like I treat me... no matter what I got on at the end of the day these clothes don‚Äôt define me so love me completely a deeply (true without bias) wine me and dine me not only because I look good but because I'm the cr√®me de la cr√®me; from my personality, to the way I move, speak, act, and treat other people. And for someone like me who finds solace in being a bad bitch Ik know deep down people will judge me regardless and treat me based on my outer appearance and that stops me from being who I wanna be, my best me, but a lot of these artists and performers just don't care and keep going and I envy them for that.",en

820,"I remenber whe someone of videos on youtube that shocked me years ago, I already knew they would go far, before Beyonce put her money/claws on them. What better way to control who can overshadow you? Especially Chloe already had a vocal talent and a natural sensuality out of the ordinary, but I don't like the direction her current performance has taken, it's closer to the bizarre as Nicky Minaj, when I imagined her elegant, radiant, singing and playing. the piano, like a mixture of Alicia Keys, Leona Lewis, Tony Braxton and Whitney Houston, and yes... Beyonc√©, but being herself at heart. I really don't see the need for her to be twerking and spanking her ass, I honestly think that lowers her level. Whether that is what she wants or what her stepmother Shasa Fierce of hers is what she has advised her to do, perhaps to mark some distance, I don't know. But I'm not really attracted to Chloe in her hyper-sexualized dances, as she moves me when I just see her face, her gestures and hear her voice. I hope that over time she finds the right path where she confirms herself as the new diva of the 21st century.",en

968,"Yall exaggerate things too much. I mean yea the song is catchy and has a nice tone but it's nothing special  Yall acting as if it's never been done before. Some people calling her icon and legend like damn chill she only released 2 singles. Don't get me wrong Im not a hater in fact I think her voice has lot of potential, i knew her voice was something since I saw the ""Moon River"" cover with her sister but she just wastes it with basic songs like this. This is literally what all new artists has been doing for over few years and it's getting boring. Nothing I can call legendary or timeless, esp with the overly sexuality thing, she pushes it too much you either have the sensuality or not, you're either sexy or not and tbh when people push it too much it becomes unattractive. Not to mention I literally wheezed when someon said the video matches perfectly with lyrics ",en
