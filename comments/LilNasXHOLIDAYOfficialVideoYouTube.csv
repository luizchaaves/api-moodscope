 In the video, Lil Nas X is shown in a fire lit room in some arctic climate dressed as a futuristic Santa Claus. When he starts singing, his first words are ‚ÄúAy, It‚Äôs a holiday; I got ho‚Äôs on ho‚Äôs and they out of control, yeah.‚Äù This immediately sets the tone for the rest of the video; he sings about christmassy things in a very detached way that is reflective of classic rap topics (Being on holiday as a synonym for having enough money to do whatever the singer would like, and ho‚Äôs being a silly connection between Saint Nick‚Äôs laugh and a term for women who the singer finds good (if not lasting) company in which is frequently used in rap. The rest of the song follows this pattern of using festive theming to change common topics in genres he is associated with into interesting wordplay. ",en
