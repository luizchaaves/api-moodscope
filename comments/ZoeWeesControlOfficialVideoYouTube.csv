152,"Tonight I have just heard this song for the first time and it was while I was at work. My colleague asked me if I was ok because while listening to this song a tear came to my eye. The song is beautiful and the way Zoe sings it you can feel the emotion, pain and anguish and for me that’s how a real song should be, it should be sung with feeling and passion. The lyrics are not only powerful but they hit home with me because I have been struggling with anxiety for most of my life (over 30 years because of childhood trauma). Do things get better? I don’t know. All I know is that I bottle up my feelings because I feel like nobody really cares, that they have their own problems to deal with and I am just the cry baby looking for attention. Not going to lie, it has taken me 20 mins just to write this because I listened to the song again and can’t stop crying, not tears of sorrow but tears of joy, joy for the fact that I am not alone, that someone out there knows how I feel on a daily basis, someone who knows how much control it takes for an anxiety sufferer to function as a ‘normal’ human being. Maybe if more people cared, if more people knew what we go through with anxiety on a daily basis and knew what this song is really saying then this song would have been an absolute smash hit. I think Zoe has done an amazing job with this song and I hope to hear more and more from her for many years to come. In the meantime I will just play this song every time I feel like I am losing control because even though it makes me cry it gives me comfort to know I am far from being alone. Well done Zoe and thank you for this beautiful and comforting song ",en

407,"This song is what I can relate to the most. I have severe OCD and anxiety. Every night, all I can do is cry. I am always so exhausted from my perfectionism and OCD rituals. It gets to the point where I spend hours repeating simple tasks like brushing my teeth. My gums start to bleed, they become swollen, and my hand becomes bruised from gripping the brush for so long. I have no control over anything anymore. There are days where I get no sleep. I just lay on the bathroom floor crying, unable to do anything but beg for it to end. By the time I finish my night time rituals, I can hardly move. Over the past few months, it has gotten so much worse. And when it comes to school, I spend the entire class just trying to make my hand writing perfect. I erase entire sentences and spend four times the amount of time editing my essays and homework. I'm awake until 4am trying to finish the smallest amount of assignments. It makes me want to collapse and never wake up again. I no longer have any motivation to do anything and I am always so exhausted. Exhausted of myself, school, life, and my brain. My biggest fear in life is failure. And recently, all I have been able to do is dwell on all of my mistakes. And it kills me from the inside. It tears me apart. And the stress from my perfectionism always leads to panic attacks. These panic attacks leave me on the ground shaking and grasping for air. But the only thing that keeps me going is my family and friends. I can't leave them.",en
