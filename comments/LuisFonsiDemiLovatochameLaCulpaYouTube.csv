535,If it reaches one soul it is of great joy. God Almighty has been revealed through his son Yeshua in hebrew ( Jesus ). Jesus is the final authority. He is the way the truth and the life. We are all born sinners. Thats why Jesus being perfect died on the cross for our sins. Jesus said there will come many after him saying they are the one. Do not listen to them. When it comes to other religions there is no other way to heaven but through Jesus. Jesus will also be the Judge of Mankind at the end of the Age.. His greatest commandments are as follows love the Lord thy God with all your strength mind and soul. The second love your neighbour as yourself. If you truely seek God you will find Yeshua ( Jesus ). It does not matter which country religion backround familly you are born in the best thing one person can do is turn from evil and accept him as your Lord and Saviour. God bless,en
