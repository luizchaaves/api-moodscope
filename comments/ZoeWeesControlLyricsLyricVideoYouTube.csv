490,You try so hard to make everyone around you love you. But sometimes you forget that you need to love yourself. You're always laughing at jokes you're always making the jokes you smile all the time. But when you're alone. You're alone... you have a rough past and it makes it so hard for you to have relationships and you're fearful it will happen again. So you build up these walls brick-by-brick shielding away everything about yourself you pretend you're happy even when you're sad because when you expressed you were sad everybody just rubbed It Off. So now you keep it to yourself under slowly drowning from your own misery. You think to yourself while you're slowly drifting down the ocean when will someone finally love me. When will you finally realize that you need to love you before you love anybody else. Sometimes you need someone to hold your hand to help you it doesn't make you weak and makes you a fighter because you fought for something. I wouldn't have made it this far I didn't have someone holding my hand. God bless all of you and remember there is somebody out there who loves you,en

My Best friend Peter and I met when we were 2 thats how my mom told me cause I can't remember that moment. We had been bestfriends for 10 years. When he was 3 he was diagnosed with a cancer. He went to therapies and for one period of time when he was around 6 he was free from cancer but u know how sometimes cancer gets back and thats what happened to him. That boy, that fighter, even right now when I'm talking about him tears are running down my checks. He was everything to me, literally everything but sadly cancer took him from me when he was 12 and I was almost 13 by that time. When my mom told me he passed away when I got from school I could feel something breaking apart but I didn't lose my cool until I was alone. He was like a family to me. I had some money that I got in my 13 years of life and I used it to decorate his grave. Now he had snacks he would eat like everyday. 24th of May it Will be 5 years since he passed away and every year I would come to his grave and eat those snacks with him, I would talk with him about some shit and he would just listen. I tried to give everything to him when he was Alive but there was only one thing I couldn't give him and that was my life so he can keep on living. If there wasn't my gf, second person I most care about after my mom and my Best friend I would already be dead cause in first I couldn't keep on living without him. So I just wona ask u so I can peacfully keep living, was I a good friend to him",en
