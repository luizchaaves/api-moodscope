I meant every word i said, but the actions contradicted it and I did not expect them to talk back nor did they as I had them in my grasp as a cup and I wonder why they didn't do anything after I abducted them and put them in chairs listening to love songs. the study was different then this, as I played something different for each person and put it on knobs as I did not want to know the details , but just the fine tuning of each person as I already knew what kind of people they were. as this as a base line I used different vibrating motors under there feet as stimulus for good behaviour and bad behaviour I used a different vibration setting and it was just as a mock and or drop and not really for laughs thrills or giggles. ""I had this on lock"" have you read about going to the phillipines and paying people to take part in my experiment where they come and look for money , but I put them in a box and they just click buttons when things appear under flashing lights?   they eventually killed that scientist I was talking to over the screen , but I knew it when he told it to me in the way he did.",en
