This is the song that i used to hear day by day but now, it's been several years and I'm glad that i got the time to reminisce this song cause it evokes fond memories of my childhood. This song is meaningful for me cause it perfectly  captures the ups and downs and most importantly the toxicity, gloomy and arguments within a relationship and one more thing, This song actually describes the vulnerability that anyone could have once they're having a hard time to cope from adversities when it comes to toxic relationship.

137,"This song always brings me to tears no matter how many times I hear it. I grew up in a extremely abusive and dysfunctional household. Though both parents were present I still suffered a tremendous amount of emtional, mental and physical abuse. I was the youngest child of 9 children, my parents struggled financially to care for us and because my father was the only one that worked there was a lot of arguements over money and bills. My sister and I were abused nearly every day by our older siblings and if not them, my father. Though my mother rarely beat us she was great at mental and emotional abuse and manipulation to such a degree she made me feel guilty for her unhappiness. She shared far too much with me on a personal level... she wanted someone to sympathize with her so I heard it all. But then she would turn on me and blame me for all sorts of things and my father (who was physically abusive as well as mentally and emotionally) would beat me so bad at times I couldn't sit or lie down because of the pain. If I cried I got beat again so I had to suffer in silence. By age 14 I couldn't take it anymore. It was draining me and I felt my sanity slipping away. I left home and never looked back. When I became a parent I told myself I would never treat my children the way I was treated. I wouldn't beat them, or make them feel a single day that they weren't loved and wanted. I eventually forgave my parents and moved on with my life... but they had to live with the guilt of knowing how horrible they made my childhood. I think I'm a much stronger woman and mother than my mother was. Though I ended up marrying a abusive man (as history tends to repeat itself) I managed to pull myself out and up from continuing to live an oppressive life.  I'm grateful to God for the strength, knowledge and wisdom that came from my life experiences and that I was able to raise my son and daughter in a much better situation. The cycle can break but you first have to be willing to face your demons, even if they are the people that brought you into this world. Confront them and let them know the suffering they inflicted on you. It may not help them, but it will free you from the hold they have over your life and emotions.",en

My sister and I experienced both physical and emotional abuse, gaslighting, manipulation, and even narcissism from our second family (yes, we were adopted because our first family, well... it is hard to explain but I don't really want to talk about it). We were fed and we can live under a house, but we cannot express our opinions under this same house because of that exact same reason. I still cry most of the times thinking how fucked up my life is. I'm already 23 years old and I still feel like a chain is still on my neck and I can't break free from it yet. Reading the comment section gave me a strange comfort and sadness at the same time. My friends would always want to turn back time to when they were a child, but I wouldn't want to anymore and they always ask me why.
