459,"Morgan threw down a random rap track years ago during a sound check and it made it's way onto TikTok. Then the people demanded he make a full song out of it.  That very cut is nothing more than one verse and a chorus of a song that could have been monumental for him but for some reason, he never completed it.  This version is great, I'm not taking anything away from it, but it could have been so much better if Morgan had completed it and done a formal release of it.  He could have still had Lil Durk in it, but it's an incomplete song that was copy and pasted into another incomplete song. If this is the first version of the song you have heard then of course you're gonna love it and that is all good & well.  If you heard it when it surfaced and hoped for a release of it then this is not what you were expecting.  It's okay though.  It's as close to a release as we're gonna get.",en
