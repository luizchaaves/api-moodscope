Was everything you ever did without purpose, and never really mattered, or will you just stop existing, after you draw your last breath? Think about this, it is the most important question of your life. There is only one chance to get it right, and it is in this lifetime. Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. Heaven is real, place of eternal bliss and perfection. Hell is real, place of eternal suffering and torment. You‚Äôre going to spend your eternity in one of those places. God's will is, that nobody would perish. One day, each and every one of us must appear before the Judgement Seat of the Holy Righteous God, and to give an account, how we have lived our life. The only way to get to Heaven is, if you‚Äôve never broken any part of God‚Äôs Law, in other words, if you‚Äôre without sin, and every single one of us have sinned. Not one person, who‚Äôs not born again from above, of the Holy Spirit, and is still in their sins, can inherit the Kingdom of God, for the wages of sin is death, and eternal damnation. Our sins separates us from God. That is why God in His love and mercy sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to atone for our sins. He left Heaven‚Äôs Throne, was God in flesh, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of a virgin, lived a holy perfect life while being in same temptations as we are, yet without sin, was condemned unjustly to death, although being innocent, was beaten, mocked, flogged, and crucified on the cross, and gave up His life and Blood willingly on our behalf, for there is no forgiveness of sins without the shedding of blood, but Christ, the spotless and unblemished Lamb of God, the Perfect Sacrifice once and for all, took the punishment of our sins on the cross, sacrificed Himself for us and paid the sin debt in full, past, present, and future, so we can be forgiven of all our sins, and be redeemed back to God, after the fall in Paradise by satan's tempting, through the Holy Precious Blood, which Jesus shed on the middle cross at Calvary, in His everlasting love towards every single one of us.",en
977,"JESUS truly loves you. He died in place of you so that one day when you die, you can be counted righteous in the presence of GOD, the FATHER. The Bible tells us that once we die, there is judgement, and we face GOD. Now, since JESUS died for you, we are to give our life to Him, accept Him as our LORD and saviour and confess with our mouths that He died and rose again on the third day (you know which is the easter we celebrate every year). So when you have accepted Him, JESUS will send the HOLY SPIRIT, which will lead you into all truths. So when this happens, your eyes, not just physical eyes but spiritual eyes, will start to open clearly. So you can see the absolute TRUTH. And also not just that JESUS will give you a new spirit which will make you a new person changing you from the old person you were to the new person you will be in CHRIST. He will give you peace and joy that no man can ever give you or that you could never find here on earth. When you fully believe and accept Him, you will find out that things you were struggling with will begin to leave you. And He can also heal you. When I said spiritual eyes, I meant we are not just physical human beings. We are also spiritual. WITH A HUMBLED HEART AND LOVE, ",en
