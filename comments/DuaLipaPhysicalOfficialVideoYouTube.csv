I requested this song from the DJ and briefly explained to them that I want to hear this song and to just confess my feelings to my crush, he just showed thumbs up and after couple songs this came on. Basically my first reaction when hearing it play was well poggers but then I just asked her to dance with me and during the second chorus we kissed in the dancefloor, after the song we'll just went to the counter to get more drinks and I basically just told how I felt towards her. She said that basically there's no need for more confessing since she felt the same towards me and thus the kiss. Been together since (FYI we're both university students)",en
