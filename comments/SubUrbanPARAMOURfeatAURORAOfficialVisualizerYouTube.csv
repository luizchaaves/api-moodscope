They develop multiple personality disorder after the father pressures them into acting like a boy. The personality that developed was a very negative boy. The father treats the male personality like it's the original and demands that they don't act like a girl ever again or they will be disowned. So the resentful male personality is given control and the true female personality is pushed and locked deep inside them. She tries to be positive internally but he gets more twisted and stressed from acting like something they aren't. The male personality was forced into existence from stress and now that they are in control they become darker and more resentful of the father.",en

It’s not even new because lots of pop/rock icons used to do stuff that wasn’t seen as “traditionally masculine” back in the days but I see a lot of negativity about this topic these days so that’s really cool to see a guy who’s as popular as him wearing this kind of outfit.",en
