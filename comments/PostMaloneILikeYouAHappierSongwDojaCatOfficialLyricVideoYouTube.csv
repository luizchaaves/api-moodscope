0,This is such a vibe,en
1,"Post is so unapologetically himself and seems to truly enjoy making his music. Success seems secondary to him now. He's comfortable enough to experiment with new sounds and themes, and I love to see it. Dude is a massive talent, and seems so genuine.",en
2,There's just something about how he pronounces words that sounds so pleasing to the ear. It's like his pronunciation is music on its own already.,en
3,two genuine people who just like being themselves while making music. success just came second. love them both.,en
4,I just added this song to my playlist whenever I am on my long night drives. So soothing in the ears. ,en

14,This song is really great it expresses tons of sounds and rhythms great song!,en
15,Posty never fails to disappoint me. Does this song put anyone else in a good chill mood? ,en
16,"This is my favorite from the album. I‚Äôve noticed that whenever Doja features on a song, she goes even harder than normal! I was hoping one day we would get treated to this collaboration because it was long overdue and they both delivered. As a new artist myself, these are two of my inspirations when it comes to producing my beats. I love the bouncy synths. This is definitely gonna be the jam of the summer! ",en
17,I just love how cute the lyrics and the beat are. Idk much about Post Malone and Doja's music so I might be wrong but I think this kind of song is so refreshing from them,en

32,Post always brings the perfect vibe!,en
33,Post and Doja have such complimentary flows and deliveries. They are both great in their own ways too but hearing them work together is always a treat. I think the fanbases are generally really similar too which is nice to see likeminded people collide every time they collab. I hope someday I can gather even a tenth of the amount of fans with the perspectives that theses two fan bases have for my own music. Truly unmatched energy,en
34,My favorite part about the music you make is that its perfectly aligns with what is going on with us in the real world  a fan from New Orleans Louisiana  timing is everything  ,en

50,My song of the summer. Idk what‚Äôs with these artists not going for a summer anthem‚Ä¶.this song is catchy and fun.,en
51,"I'm finally realizing the aesthetic Post Malone was going with. He does say, ""Everything done for the dead after they're dead is for the living,"" thus showing life frozen in place, he even described the album as a ""living, breathing entity almost."" The fact that these life forms are frozen in place like the fish or just simply stuck in time, shows how Post perceives the world and how the present matters to him dearly because all we do is use beings after they die.",en

891,"Has anyone ever told you that God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life? Do you know beyond a shadow of doubt, if you were to die this second, if you would go to heaven? The Holy Bible says all have sinned and come short of the glory of God and the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. The Bible also says that WHOSOEVER shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. YOU are a whosoever. You can know right now! Say this with your mouth and heart out loud! ‚ÄúDear Lord Jesus, come into my heart. Forgive me of my sin. Wash me and cleanse me. Set me free. Jesus thank you, thank you died for me. I believe, you have risen from the dead and that you are coming back again for me. Fill me with your Holy Spirit, give me a passion for the lost, a hunger for the things of God, and a Holy boldness to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I‚Äôm saved. I‚Äôm born again. I‚Äôm forgiven and I‚Äôm on my way to heaven because I have Jesus in my heart. Amen.‚Äù ",en
