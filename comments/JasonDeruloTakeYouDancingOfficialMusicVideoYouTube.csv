509,"Elevation of mind, elicited by exotic flavours embellishing an emerald green island, renders me enticed up onto a cliff by the secretive sea. With my intuition freely expanding upon interaction with the mystical wind, I am able to feel the soothing view reaching out to me. Just before time is about to fully lose its grip on the aquatic animation, relaxed reflection approaches me with the offer of setting sail for a world record at 123 457 decimals, embedded in spiritual waves, and as my gaze returns with questions regarding whether or not the memorization this time might require of me to deal with the hardships of swimming stubbornly, and thus parting ways with any risk of drowning in surreal slumber down the road, supportive exhaustion lets my eyes close to guidance from the timelessly expressive rhythm of waves. Then, in the midst of the tranquil heartbeats of time, starting with the sound from a dam of clouds rupturing up above, followed by an unfolding waterfall of sunrays spoiling my focus with red-violet nuances over my eyelids, is when my restless reflections realize the opportunity to fall back into the hands of a wind falling up in the profound sky, and upon their granted release at vibrant heights they could be perceived migrating, free as birds, towards heavenly and levitating landscapes. Speeding through the atmosphere, tuning in to its intrinsically inspiring symphony, they surrender to falling into a vividly deep dive through rings of rejuvenating sunlight, up until the blinding increase in energy has the passage of breathing scenery spiralling spontaneously. Streched out like wings belonging to an eagle, embracing the environment, they eagerly take up snorkeling in an ocean of clouds, leaving behind a shockwave of bubbling foam followed by dolphins, whose skyhigh harmony unloads a barrage of thoughtful beings towards the increasingly bright light over the sea surface, in which they end up being swung between elastic noses of dolphins to the point where my each and every reflection jumps on the opportunity of taking the shape of pinballs displaying a madly agile smile. Enwrapped in hypnosis by the large number of falling stars, they eventually find themselves escorted by them cuddly telepathic players navigating through layers of darkness on the ocean floor and all the way to the awaiting foot of an undersea volcano, where the glowing flow of energy sends them scaling up the deceptively ancient structure, on top of which the crunch from their scintillating expectations brings the following moment to shoot my reflections right out into the arms of the heavenly kingdom. Whilst immersing themselves in the luxurious feeling from slowly journeying through fluffy air, little did they anticipate the emerging slope rendering them rolling downhill and closing in on a looming loop in which they would be thrown around and plunged up somersaulting with phenomenal grace in the rain of applause from stars gathered in graceful formation, all until reflecting thoughts come falling from the sky only to land bouncing between mirages of palm trees preceeding the distracting sound from whirlwinds dancing to the golden sound of solar energy being agelessly unleashed. Refreshingly weakend by all the involving heat, a rinsing river leaves the thoughtful forces cruising alongside radiant rays suddenly starting to transform into harmoniously homing missiles, and the very moment my every reflection is given the green light to rocket itself all the way up to its exclusively desired, groovy viewpoint inside of the celestial sphere and behold future memories of waves of light diving divinely into the living water, fast-forwarding fantasy opens the door for the gravitational field of reality to spin around. Charged with handsomely hightening homesickness, they fall like a burning bolt of lightning all the way down into a path of steaming water vapour, which they rally past with thunderous rolls leading into a visual field painting the verdant island with earthshaking and electrifying precision, and despite insightful inspiration teasing the idea of soaring reflecting in the gloriously unexplored wreath of water, reflections of mine depart with unregretful acceleration for the bobbing boat, atop the mast of which they reappear nosediving into a movement of resplendent pirouettes.",en
