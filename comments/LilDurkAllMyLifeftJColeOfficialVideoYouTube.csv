I feel like all of Durk‚Äôs bars come from an honest place that goes deeper than rap, and Cole has quite a few bars that are just cool and witty but they come off as shallow with only a few genuine thoughts scattered in between. It‚Äôs decent, but Cole‚Äôs verse just doesn‚Äôt match the effortless depth and honesty of Durk‚Äôs. For the first time in a long time, Cole had the weaker verse, in my humble opinion. I would‚Äôve rather seen a Kendrick feature on this track. I don‚Äôt think Kenny would‚Äôve squandered it. Before you get upset, I‚Äôm pretty sure Cole would agree that he‚Äôs doing a lot of rapping about rapping while Durk is rapping about life‚Äôs struggles and rising above circumstance. Cole touches on those topics here and there but there are a lot of throwaway lines in between. Think about it.",en
