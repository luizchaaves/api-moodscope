1045,"Ya’ll aren’t gonna like this, but I’m gonna say it anyway: J. Cole is dead weight on this track. I feel like all of Durk’s bars come from an honest place that goes deeper than rap, and Cole has quite a few bars that are just cool and witty but they come off as shallow with only a few genuine thoughts scattered in between. It’s decent, but Cole’s verse just doesn’t match the effortless depth and honesty of Durk’s. For the first time in a long time, Cole had the weaker verse, in my humble opinion. I would’ve rather seen a Kendrick feature on this track. I don’t think Kenny would’ve squandered it. Before you get upset, I’m pretty sure Cole would agree that he’s doing a lot of rapping about rapping while Durk is rapping about life’s struggles and rising above circumstance. Cole touches on those topics here and there but there are a lot of throwaway lines in between. Think about it.",en
