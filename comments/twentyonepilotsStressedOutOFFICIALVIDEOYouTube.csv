I miss times that I've never lived in. I would want to spend some time in '90s in my homeland - Poland (end of communism, fantastic music, disco party 3 times a week) and in the USA (just look at movies and recordings and you will probably understand). The main reason in different, though. It is that we were all together. People were meeting, there was pretty much time for everything. If the time travel will be invented in future, I'll spend all my money (even if I'll be homeless after that) to spend as much time as I can in the 90's.
