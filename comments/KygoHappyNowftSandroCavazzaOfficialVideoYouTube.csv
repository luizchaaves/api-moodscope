I am holding on and trying so much to make up go back to normal but we have been in this vicious cycle of arguing for about over a month now. We get through everything together but this time, I think we need to cut our loses and move forward in life. I love him a lot but its hurting me see him become someone he isnt and as well as this spiral down into this sort of sadness when he isnt around me. I just feel as if he is forcing himself into this relationship with me like i sort of am with him. Unfortunately you cant force love and I have now accepted that.
