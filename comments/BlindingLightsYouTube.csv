You'll be confused, nauseous, dizzy, feel painfully sick, and your logic and ability to perceive left from right, up from down, won't work anymore. That's because the grace of the Creator which gave you those abilities will be forever gone at that point, much like your free will already is gone now as you serve the satanic hive mind and are a slave to it. There's no time in perdition, so your time there will never end. There is no where you can go in the abyss, because everywhere you walk melts away or circles back on itself. You'll hear the wailings of other tares in there with you, but you won't be able to find them. Sleep is impossible, so is eating or drinking.

951,"FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST, WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM SHALL NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE  EVERLASTING LIFE IN HEAVEN FOREVER AND EVER. John 3:16 Bible....THE RAINBOWTHRONE OF SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST AND THE TREE OF LIFE, Revelation 4 and Revelation 22 Bible. And whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.This is the second death. Revelations 20 bible.... I SAW A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. 2 Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 3 And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God. 4 And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.”",en

960,"Jesus Christ is the son of God. He was crucified, died, and was laid in a tomb. On the third day God raised his son Jesus from the dead. God has given all authority to his son Jesus Christ. He will reign over the earth whether you want him to or not. If you don't bow before Jesus now, you WILL later. But, then it will be too late. Jesus is coming back again to judge the living and the dead. If you will repent of your sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, then God will wash away your sins and promise you that He will give you the gift of the Holy Ghost.",en
