She is upset that he is back into dating, specially another young woman she disaproves of.

Thankfully, she and her friends have self-snitched about it all in this song and also they have left fingerprints, footprints and all type of bodily matter around the bedroom, kitchen and bathroom, recorded their exploits and for maximum convenience for this poor attacked family when they report the crime to the cops, they left the camera recorder with footprints and everything inside the house.
