Twenty years ago someone I was never really that close to told me something that has never been more true than it is now. That the path I was about to choose wasn’t what I thought it was. It was everything but that and those people would take everything good about me and use it against me until I became like them. Looking back it’s the fact that we weren’t that close and yet he still gave enough of a shit about me to say what he did is the reason it stuck with me. One of the few people I’ve had in my life that cared enough to just tell me the truth of things. I struggled with his death for 20 years because of it. ",en

God knows I don’t have any where near the talent Abel possesses, but my goal for this year is to just improve the quality of my beats and create the best music I am capable of, even if it never matches up to this masterpiece of an album.

I have listened and loved The Weeknd for years and years now, and I love all his eras, but what I love the most about him is that he doesn't stay in one place, he evolves. He finds these unique ways to make music that is art and every release makes me even more amazed. I truly think he is the best artist of our time. Many people are saying they miss ""the old"" him, but I think if he kept creating music that is always the same and always like Trilogy, he wouldn't show us his full art potential.

Like past the drugs, meaningless sex, cheating, hes found the light and breaks free, like the video shows. Maybe its just me projecting after two years of covid, but the sense of self discovery and meaning can be seen everywhere in the album, especially with him not wanting to sacrifice himself for a love or fling or whatever it should be called, that ultimately wont help him more than the colour in his own life can, despite that bringing a little bit of vibrance.",en

In the end of Phantom Regret I feel like it is so surreal and gives you the feelings of regretting not doing enough in your life, and wanting to go back, which is why the line “In other words, you’ve gotta be heaven to see heaven” hits so hard and shows the imperfect feeling of humanity in my opinion.",en

644,"My take on this is in more of a literal way. The Weeknd is at the forefront of the music industry and is reaching the highest levels of success. The industry behind the scenes is dark and cult like (hence the people in the black drapes) who work together to spread evil in any form under the control of one person (devil) symbolised by the single red draped person. To elevate his success he has to participate in these rituals which incorporate a level of ‘sacrifice’ but his future self is warning him not to even though his reward is the elevated levels of success and money, he is losing part of his soul, shown by the light pulling out his aura or soul. Another scene which links to this is where he is chained to the mic. He is bound to his ritual and must complete his part of the deal, whereby it looks all shiny and perfect on the outside but when he becomes unshackled he then realises, it is not as good as it is made out to be. His future self is warning him that in return for the favours of the devil and his assistance in obtaining The Weeknds (Abel’s) desires, he must sell his soul and is at the mercy of the devil.",en
