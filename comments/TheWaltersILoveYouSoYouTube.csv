5,"I remember finding this song years ago, and I added it to my playlist. This song was playing in the background(along with other songs) while I was talking with a certain someone. After that someone and I stopped talking, I forgot about this song. While I was scrolling through TikTok, I came across someone using this sound, and it made me remember everything, from the sleepless nights, early mornings, and cheesy afternoons. The high we felt late at night, the moments we shared, laughing at the silliest inside jokes we make, while the others are clueless of why we were laughing. It was nice finding this song again, but I wish I didn't, because it reopened some wounds. But if I didn't today, I would probably still encounter it on a later date. I guess it's for the best that we stopped, but I wish you would've given me a heads up, I was not ready at all.",en

He greets my mom and looks over to me saying ""Hi, sorry for crashing your dinner, Im J"" I could feel the tears welling up in my eyes as I responded with ""I know, it's me, Cas.""

71,"Heard this song and vibed out to it with the person I loved, not really looking into the songs meaning. Fast forward a year later, she broke up with me. I always blamed myself and thought I wasn’t enough as a reason for it. Later I found out she had other lovers and many flings with “friends”. One even flew out to her (while we were still together and behind my back) just to smash. During that time, despite all the lies and things she did behind my back, I couldn’t really accept it……because “I loved her so”. It took some time to finally let go. Whenever I hear this song it reminds me that I dodged a bullet and made me realize everything happens in life for a reason. I don’t usually leave comments, but I wanted to remind anyone who has gone through a rough break up that “it’s not the end of the world and that you are the master of your own life and future”.",en

Her personality is really nice, and she is everything I want in a girl. We’ll see what happens as time passes I guess.

Edit: I got a girlfriend last month, and no it wasn’t the girl I did like (I lost interest in her). I liked her friend, who was friends with me as well. She did ask me out, so with excitement, I obviously say yes. Within a few days, I somewhat regretted it. She was really nice, but I thought she was more of a sister to me. That’s the way it seemed anyway. I said that she deserved someone better than me, and that we would be better as friends. She did say that we can still be friends. Next day, I ask her, how her day is going, the usual sort of stuff. Anyway, the next Monday, she acted like she didn’t even like me at all, like she hated me. Not a single word all day.",en

223,"This song makes me think of my old best friend, I met her when I was 13 and we were in eighth grade. She didn’t like me at first but I knew from the very beginning that we would have something meaningful one day. The whole school knew we were inseparable, you’d never see one without the other, we did everything together, spent every summer together, every waking moment she was always the light of my life & I was truly in love with her, and those big green eyes. She knew the ins and outs of me, we cried together, but laughed together even harder. And I guess as we got older we just somehow grew apart… by senior year we weren’t even living in the same state, even though we’d take bus rides to see each other whenever we could. Loving her was like a movie. And then she started going thru things and pushing me to the side, and I begged her not to leave me one time. I was so afraid of a future where she wasn’t in it. I knew I had to let go when I realized I wasn’t even the main character in my own movie, it was her. She consumed me & swallowed me whole. I chased her, I gave her every ounce of love that I had and when she left I was filled with rage. I was so angry at the world and at god. I couldn’t wrap my head around why I could experience such a beautiful connection where it felt like the world was at my feet, to just feeling plain pitiful, defeated, and lost. It’s been 2 years & She’s reached out to see how I’m doing a couple times. I have no idea what to say because, I’m still trying to put these feelings together, still trying to see the world as colorful as I once did. We have each others names tattooed and and I don’t know if I’ll ever have strength to cover it. I’m still holding on because I love her so. So. much.",en

I like  this boy since 2019. We were kinda of friends. We met because he's my brother's friend. I started liking him. I felt a connection, like  we would get along really well if we got together, a connection I can't explain. The pandemic came in and we fell apart. We didn't talk at all, I felt like he forgot me. Last summer, I told him that I liked him. He rejected me, said I was a great person but he didn't felt the same and that I was brave to say my feelings, he was so nice. Time passed by and everything stayed the same. We changed and grew up. A little bit  before school started this year I started talking to him again,but the same day I found out he had a girlfriend. School started, we walked the same corridors, had some same teachers (although hes one year older than me) but we don't talk. Maybe he still feels awkward with me. Two days ago he started to take notice of me again, looking at me more often, liking my posts. I dont know if hes still in a relationship or not, but I never see him and his supposed girlfriend talk in school. I hope things change this year, I really want to be close to him, even if I'm just a friend to him.",en

I had a crush on this girl. We didn't know each other that well but we had a lot in common. I thought she would be the girl that I would spend my life with, relationship or not.

We sat together in class and passed notes to each other and became friends. I was crushing on somebody else at the time but soon realized as I grew closer to her, that I still liked her. I fell for her harder than I did before and it was crushing me. She got into a relationship with someone else which was like another sign for me. But a few months later they break up. I'm there for my friend and I feel crushed seeing her hurt. Another year goes by I still like her, thinking that she's the one for me. Or that I'm the one for her. I knew that I would treat her better and make her smile and laugh. But, one day my best friend yells at me and begs me to tell my crush that i like her and I obviously say that I won't (""I'm too shy and she doesn't like me""). After a while of fighting I finally give in and tell my crush how I feel.

They start dating just around new years start and Im devastated, I got over her though and I was happy for them. March comes around and they start having problems in their relationship, he just stopped trying and it felt like he was neglecting her (keep in mind he asked her out). Then she came to me for comfort and knowing me I naturally comfort her as a good friend, this becomes a regular thing where she comes to me and I give her advice. Her bf, my best friend starts getting jealous and tells her she needs more trustworthy friends to talk to and then he recommends his friends (girls) so that they can inform him of anything she says. Naturally she says no and continues talking to me, at this point i feel like I need to back off because I might cause problems for their relationship. So I start giving both of them advice, she listens and he doesn't however during spring break they finally have a conversation after he's been ignoring her for a week, he says he wants to fix things. Later that day he breaks up with her, and she breaks down she truly loved him. Then she goes to me again for advice and comfort, just seeing him makes her cry and he's in a couple of her classes. I start falling for her again but I really don't want her to misunderstand that I'm just comforting her because I wanna date her. I just truly care for her, one of my friends told me that I should distance myself slowly but it's killing me because I love her and it may seem farfetched but I truly do. I'd do anything for her to be happy even if it means that I'm not. I really wanna tell her this but I don't know if it'll ruin our friendship.

599,"I thought I didn't like this one girl, I heard tons of rumors about her being a play girl or rather a person who is scared to commit and literally play with peoples feelings..? My friends told me that she's that and she does this... One day I noticed she was actually quite a good friend or rather a nice person. We became close, she then started to tease or flirt with me. I thought it was some joke or friendly flirt. We became much closer after that, I noticed that we started updating everything that we're doing and she continued on flirting with me non-stop. My friends who knew her since elementary, said she's just like that, a very flirty girl. So I was confused and all and asked her. ""are your feelings towards me serious?"" she then replied with a yes.. that time I was still unsure about her. But there arrived the day that I like her and told her I'm unsure about her. I explained why it's hard for me to like her. She used to date this one guy and then proceed to chase another guy and then even worse she's entertaining a 3rd guy, that was a long time ago. Now she explained that all of it was just a misunderstanding and thats just how people saw it. I believed her but not fully as almost everyone I know that knew her said that she's very complicated. I really liked her so I really thought that I could trust her. And then I did it, I asked if I could court her, she said yes. With that, multiple problems occurred, I often overthink about the boys she hangs with after knowing her past... Theres this one guy she's close with, my friend who knew them explained that they've known each other for a long time and that that guy likes her, she then explained me that they only have a platonic relationship and that she doesn't think of anything romantic towards that guy. So I then trusted her again. Now another conflict, there's this guy who is her childhood friend - I guess as they live at the same province, they go home together. I was inviting her to a date she declined and told me she had to go home immediately after school as her service transportation had a reason. To my surprise, when I asked her if she's home she said no and that she's with the childhood friend to the place I was asking her to go with me.. I got mad, she said that her service unexpectedly couldn't arrive and that she had to go with the childhood friend for company in riding a public transportation and that the guy invited to drink at that place. I understood her again and trusted her. I really liked her despite all the red flags.. Or I can even say I love her... She's the first person who made me feel special and she even said that it's her first time being like an another person(she became softer and nicer because of me) because I'm different she said. All my friends said that she's just really complicated and if I really love her I should trust her but it is ultimately my decision to pursue this painful thing. Mrs. Matcha, if you ever see this please know that I am blindly in love with you, despite you hurting my feelings every time you do something that you don't know its hurting me.

625,"Well, here I am commenting my thoughts and feelings on another music video. I don’t mind if no one reads this- after all anyone would just forget I ever existed, forgetting this comment and everything. I know no one truly cares I guess.

I’m a fifteen year old living in a small town in Connecticut. There’s so many shit people here, so many good people as well. But honestly, I can’t stand speaking like this. Just seeing myself type, seeing my fingers. Makes me not even care about writing but I’ll continue because I can’t sleep anyways. In 2019, I was diagnosed with depression. I’ve always have had problems with self love and self harm. I sound so fucking stupid talking about me being an idiot. But it’s just a back and forth with myself with these types of things yknow? It’s like some days I want to, and somedays I just think about my stupidity without any emotion, with no care. I’ve had a few relationships in my life, but I’ve been manipulated in half of them I guess. But since I’ve said this much I’ll just say everything about myself. I have schizophrenia, and it’s been hard dealing with it as of late, I recently had an episode in a mall with my current girlfriend and her mother, as well as her brother. I was seeing posters looking at me, and some items melting or closing in on me. I always feel nauseous when i start feeling and seeing things, I could barely even keep myself together. Seeing people look at me, feeling nauseous, seeing things melt or distort. I feel like screaming into the phone recalling all of this because I’m just tired of this. I’m a sadistic person most the time though, I fantasize about hurting or killing people because of what they say, whether it’s to me or someone else. I try to get out of my head and be nice, someone different I guess. But it’s all different when I’m left with myself. I’m just quiet, wishing that I’d just die some day. And honestly man, I’ve lost most of my friends. The friend that still claims that he’s my best friend. He never texts me, never calls, never cares I guess. Now I understand he has his own problems, I don’t like being selfish like that so I just leave him be. But I’ve stopped caring about everything lately. Not like “nothing matters” but it’s like “I don’t care” like I could get beaten in a fight, but who cares? No one does, because it doesn’t fucking matter. Now I’ve lost motivation to type more because I’m just lost, tired, and hungry I guess. So now I’m stuck in my bed at 4:26AM. Hey, at least I have a roof under my head. Some people don’t but I still complain about my problems as a 14 year old. Listening to this song on loop because I’m typing this long.  Goodnight I suppose, have a great life.",en

She would get mad at me for simple stuff that obviously weren’t rude and weren’t directed towards anyone and if another one of her friends did the same thing she would find it funny. I remember I used to always desperately try to get her approval by making her laugh for example and I just don’t know why. I just stopped using my insta account since I felt pressured to text her and if I used it she could see I was online so we haven’t talked in over a year. We have only been friends for around 4 months and even though I feel much happier now than when I was with her, I still kinda miss it and kinda love her too, (not romantically) but I don’t wanna go back to that again. Though I actually forgive her since I think there’s no point in holding a grudge and keeping things awkward and it just makes you a better person.

He would ask for some stuff I wasn’t really comfortable with but I would say yes out of fear of losing him. One day he asked me how to ask out someone, and my heart dropped. A part of me thought that it would be me. It wasn’t. He ended things after three weeks and no matter how long ago it was it still hurts. I never knew how attached I could get in three weeks.

And then there was me, the weird boy of the classroom, dunno why, but still making the same damn mistakes that make me look like an disrespectful, immature and clumsy person. She ended up discovering my attraction to her, and kindly told me she was… not interested in me. And I hate to be that kind of insistent person, so if it she didn’t desire to be with me, I respected her decision and stopped trying. It passed 8 grade, 9 grade, 10 grade, 11 grade… I tried so hard just to forget what I felt, to find reasons to hate her, even expected her to date another one just to tell myself “nothing to do here bro, at least she’s happy”(never happened)… all just to stop loving her. I couldn’t abandon my feelings for the one person that was so close and so far at the same time.
