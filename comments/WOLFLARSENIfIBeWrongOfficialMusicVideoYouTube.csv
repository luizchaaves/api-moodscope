263,"Don't we all doubt ourselves and motives now and again? Are we not self aware at some point in life of how and in what ways we have failed and are imperfect? If you yourself aren't already questioning these things, people certainly bring those questions, and as much as you try to ignore them, they are there.  The desire to be loved and share in that space is palpable, at least for me. And you know that at any time or moment, that person in whom you desire to share that space with you, can leave. You are sure of yourself, despite the doubts and don't need any saving. You just are. And no matter how right or wrong we are, we just want to be allowed to share in that space with another person.

I know the ideas I've had may not be it. ButI see this older  woman looking at the dancer as a free spirit  she either used to be or  wishes she had been or wants to be now.
