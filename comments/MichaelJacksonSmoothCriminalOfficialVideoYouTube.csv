Like having people playing those instruments, those sitting while moving to the rhythm, those acting even while dancing, those fighting, those gambling, the ones playing snookers too, let's not forget the ballet dance part. Everybody in the club is just participating or involved in one thing. Also having a stage to perform where there is a microphone for you to sing, there is a spot light too. Having a place like brothel where MJ's money was stolen by one of the girls. So many",en
