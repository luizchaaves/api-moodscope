2,"This one is my favourite from After Hours. I think this track represents the whole album: first part is full of peace, the author describes his affection to his loved one - first few tracks from the album are about it. He tells her he'll never leave her.
In the second part (starting with ,,my darkest hours"" verse) the tempo is faster and we know from lyrics that he is in the party, probably with other girls. We know that he came back to his old ways (Hearthless, Faith, maybe a part of Blinding Lights - in these songs he is the other version of himself, the 'party' version).",en
