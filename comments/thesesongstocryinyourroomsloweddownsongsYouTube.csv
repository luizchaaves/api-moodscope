Hey, you, yes, I am talking right to you. I hope you will see yourself with the eyes I see you one day because I can tell you have some awesome music taste :) You‚Äôre such a beautiful human being and worth and enough. I hope you know that you do only need yourself to be happy, I know society builds up the standard that whenever you‚Äôre alone you‚Äôre not living a happy life. But in fact, that is not true, if you start to realize that you actually deserve all the good things happening to you, you will treat yourself a lot nicer. I hope you let yourself rest, don‚Äôt beat yourself up over past mistakes, over regret, and over everything your mind wants to destroy you. I wish I could remove all those demons inside of your head because you deserve to feel happy. If you ever feel lonely then watch the sky, because you know, someone, at the same time is watching the sky too, maybe feeling the same way...I am glad you exist and I hope you won‚Äôt ever remove your own spot in this world, maybe you don‚Äôt feel like you belong here but, Angel, then build your home here. I don‚Äôt want you to leave this world unhappy. I want you to live every little second, I want you to feel alive, I don‚Äôt want you to see yourself just existing. You deserve it. Whatever happened, it‚Äôs not your fault, the demons in your head recognize that you have a beautiful heart, they want to take it because they have never seen such a beautiful heart as yours, so why let them win over you? . You‚Äôre not selfish for isolating yourself, but you deserve to talk to someone. If you‚Äôre reading this then please never forget to breathe and smile. ",en

25,"when ever I hear these song, it reminds me of a time. A time when I didn't have to worry about anything, didn't have problems, talked and played outside with my friends for hours just to come home later and play on the game with them. It brings me back to times when I was happy and I had everything I needed. I don't have that anymore. I moved away from my friends and we don't talk really anymore. I drown in schoolwork and have no time do anything with anyone. I only have time to think of what once was. When life was good, when life was enjoyable and I had no problems. These songs brings me back to a time when I was just me and wasn't worried about anything. I would do anything to go back to those times. just to know what its like to be happy again and to be surrounded by people that care. This song is nostalgic and every time I hear it, it brings me to tears because I know it will never be like that again. Im so grateful for those friends. They helped me just be me. I hope they are doing well and maybe I will talk to them again in the future. Maybe I might find the perfect girl, but until then, im stuck, falling through the endless void of which is my thoughts, just waiting for something to happen...

61,What hurts the most is when you love someone so much and your best friend takes them. I keep a smile around my best friend and his girlfriend. I love her so much. He got her first so I can‚Äôt be mad at him but it hurts every day when I see her. That is a permanent feeling I get all the time. A peace of empty space that can only be filled by her and it will never be filled. That is the worst because around them you have to congratulate but at the same time hate it so much because you wish it could be you in her arms. When you ask to hang out with him  and he says no I am hanging out with her and you feel lonely and jealousy at the same time. When you go to sleep crying because the next day you try to impress her. When you wake up and the first thing you think of is her. When she comes and talks to you and you have a normal conversation but in your mind you almost can‚Äôt hold back telling her that you love her with all your heart. She is all you think about and your friend takes you for granted. He talks about that he would rather do something else or gets in an argument with her and just says whatever when I would be on my knees begging her for her to accept my apology even if I did nothing wrong. I want her to look at me during class not me look at her whenever I get the chance. When I have to change my schedule so I can be in the same room as her. Talking to my friend and asking questions about her like what is it like being with her and what her favorite thing to do is. That hurts the worst because no matter how hard you try you can never get rid of the feeling of love.,en

118,"Ya know, it's funny. How I went from being the worst I've been in years to perfectly fine. It's crazy how in seconds you can save me from drowning waters, but the moment you turn away, I'm lost at sea again. Maybe you're my anchor. Keeping me in place during the thrashing waters. Maybe you're the thing keeping me afloat. Keeping my will strong. Making my body able to endure. Or maybe it's all just temporary hope. False strength from the ever fleeting moment. I mean. Humanity has a way of repeating itself, and I wouldn't be writing this if it hadn't happened to me at least once. Hehe. I say once... but the number of times I've been used for my belongings and/or body just to be tossed aside till the next time I'm "" needed ""... it feels like it's all I'm good for. Like I'm made to give, but ill never see the same kinda love or care I give others. So what makes you different from them? Who's to say it won't happen again? I.. It would be the last time it happens. Period. End of story. I just hope fate doesn't have something else planned for us. You're the best thing that's happened to me in years. And fate has a horrendous habit of pulling people out of your life when you feel you need them most. Sure, you can tell yourself that "" it was time for them to go "" or that you're "" better off without them,"" but the truth of the matter is that you still went through it. That pain will always be there no matter what you do. A part of you is gone, and you're expected to be perfectly OK. And again, sure you can pride yourself on the fact you made it another day. That you're getting stronger. But for what? To have to fight the battle again the next day? And that pride you feel? It's just an outcome of  shame. Your body trying to overcome it all. And gaining confidence from thriving is such an environment. And with your ego and spirits high, you fall again. Harder this time. Breaking and cracking more parts of you you didn't even know you had. God life is great. But I think I'm getting attached again. And I'm sacred. Bc when I'm not with him... idk. It's not the same. When he's there I feel I can rest. I feel comfortable and safe. I feel at home when I'm with him. And it scares me bc I've felt this before. Maybe not exactly the same feeling but close enough. And ik this won't end well. I just have that feeling. He's in it for the sex. For the free shit. For what I can give. And even if he isn't how am I of all people suppose to be enough for him? How am I supposed to be good enough to make him happy and I'm not even good enough for my friends. My family. Let alone myself. I'm too clingy. Too loud and obnoxious. I get startled to easy and freak out too much over any and everything. There's no way I'll be enough and it's only a matter of time till he starts looking for someone else. And I'll be right back to drowning by myself again. That why I can't stay too long.  That's why I can't get too attached. That's why I can't call it love. I know it's going to happen.

I'm 17 now broken into so many pieces but I'm staying and faking it cuz I'm an online mother to many children. I'll keep them safe and take their pain away. If y'all reading this people with cancer never be the same as they was before. But I'm happy to share y'all about my illnesses. But I need help badly my therapist isn't helping me she just babying me I'm not a child I just want to be treated normal idc if I have memory lost either I just want to be normal.,en

it‚Äôs midnight. And I am no longer in control, I like someone. A girl. But I follow god. And I‚Äôve been taught this is wrong and made feel bad if I ever even thought of the idea. So I have to marry a man or never be with anyone. And I just cant fathom the idea of giving up on a part of myself that makes me feel like I actually belong. I was talking to this girl and we just instantly clicked I feel I actually love her. She‚Äôs the most beautiful girl ever. Her laugh makes me laugh. Her voice, her voice is music to my ears. Seeing her just makes me smile. She is everything I love. Her eyes carry so much love and laughter I can‚Äôt look away.her smile makes me feel happy and full. The way she carries herself with such confidence. The way she talks. The way she decides to dress. The way she speaks to me are all things that have made me fall deeper in love with her everyday i talk to her. But I have to let her go. And I don‚Äôt think a man will ever have me feeling this way, I‚Äôve never felt this way about any previous guys. Only her. She‚Äôs so amazing and I have to let her go. I have to let her be only a friend to me. I have to watch her fall in love with someone new because I can‚Äôt be with her. And I have to watch her build her life with someone else she decides to love. Sure I could go against god. But that‚Äôs another part of my life that makes me feel full. I felt complete with her and god in my life but I can‚Äôt have them both. And I just don‚Äôt know how to deal. I love her. But I can‚Äôt be with her.
