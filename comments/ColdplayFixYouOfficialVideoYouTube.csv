11,"After 15 awesome years, looks like my dog is about to give in. This song never made so much sense to me and never made me cry this much before. This is the power of music. It connects with you, and wake these emotions you had inside of you but didn't even knew. Some people may think it's kinda ridiculous to feel like this for a pet, but he's not just a pet. He's a family member. He's my younger brother. And i kind of got the chorus on reverse. I tried to ""fix"" him, but seems like soon the lights will guide him and ignite his bones. I hope that, wherever he goes, is somewhere with no pain and chicken fillet rains every thursday. But he'll have to make new friends, because i won't be there for him for some time. I hope he knows that one day i'll go pick him up.",en
