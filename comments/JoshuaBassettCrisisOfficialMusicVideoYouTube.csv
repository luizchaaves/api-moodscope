0,The fact he sings about death threats he got and he’s donating the money off his song to mental health organizations. Yeah he’s got my support 100%,en
1,“Momma called cause she heard I got death threats” being a mom of 3 boys this hit my heart!! I felt that so much us mothers only want our babies to be safe and happy and loved :( This is a beautiful song,en
2,A lot of people compare early Taylor Swift to Olivia but I honestly think Joshua compares more to later Taylor.. the maturity in his songs and the stunning guitar reflects the sombre emotion of somebody who has been trampled over but doesn’t want to take revenge.,en
3,"""but you sensationalise, keep fanning the fire for the headlines."" SO GOOD. His songwriting skills omg.",en
4,Joshua definitely wins this one. He’s actually expressing his emotions and explaining his side instead of blaming the other person.,en
5,"This song never gets old. No matter how much I listen, I never get bored.",en
6,"I think it was extremely wise of him to wait to release this. At the time all the drama popped off, his side would have been irrelevant. The fans were raging and painting him as the villain. Now that the dust has settled and the emotions have passed, we can all hear him clearly. I respect him a lot for this. He shared the part of the music industry we never get to hear about. He straight up addressed how that situation affected him and all without having to do any interviews lol. I hope when he's asked about this again in the future, he can point to this song and just say ""Listen to this."" and leave it at that.",en
7,"This song is like... so emotional. He got so much hate when olivia's fan didn't even know half the truth. The effect hate can have over one is tremendous, it really really messes with one's mental health and I hope this doesn't happen to anyone ever again. It's completely fine when we love a song, keep vibing with it but it's NEVER OKAY to give death threats or hate someone JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE A FAN!",en
8,"After SOUR everyone labelled Joshua as the bad guy and people didn't even bother trying to listen to his side of it. I love how he just explains how he's being treated (by fans not Olivia) through his music. The reason he's one of my favourite singers is because his songs are more than just relatable. You can easily find songs everywhere of people saying someone broke up with them and how their hurting but its difficult to find songs that portray the feelings of the one who ended it, the one who's reasons are never heard. So finally being able to find an artist that describes these emotions makes me feel better. I was labelled the bad guy by every single person I knew and no one tried to listen to me. And Joshua's songs always speak for me. He's an underrated artist and he deserves more recognition.",en
9,"After listening to the Sour album and all of Josh’s songs (and now these 3 new ones) I’m with Josh on this. Both sides need to be heard, and it’s heartbreaking he got death threats. Olivia did some damage. He’s not digging at her here. He’s expressing himself.",en
10,"I remember being so worried for Joshua earlier in the year after all the drama. All the hate towards him was so horrible. People will grow apart from others and that's understandable, so I never hated him when Olivia released those songs. I hope he's doing alright now. This is also such a beautiful song too :)",en
11,“Messing with my life as a career move” damn... he’s awesome. I can’t believe Olivia’s fans sent him death threats... it’s insane. How fucking pathetic could you be to care THAT much about the life of someone you don’t even know.,en
12,just the fact hes donating 100% of it to mental health charities is so f*cking nice this man is so f*ucking kind,en
13,"""Half the shit you're sayin' is only half true You're messin' with my life as a career move"" 
Damn that hits hard!!!",en
14,The fact that Liv did nothing for the death threats and kept the drama going on over and over again just hurts me. I loved both of them so much. I was never picking sides. But this is just making me sad. Making everything about yourself isnt cool. and Liv did exactly that,en
15,"I felt this… so real and authentic. Joshua shouldn’t be compared with any other artist, I think he has his own sound and aesthetic. Talent.",en
16,His side of the story is just as relevant as Olivia's. I hope everyone that listened to drivers license and SOUR also hears this,en
17,"this song is so good! he didn’t talk about the breakup in an aggressive way, he was calm, and made his points very clear! and didn’t give him all the credit, bc he knew that he wasn’t perfect too. “don’t go thinking i didn’t hurt too.” is so so sweet! and i love how he is donating all of the profits for charity for mental health crisis’s! he could’ve bought stuff for himself, but no! he has my side! ",en
18,"The lyric at 1:20 about the death threats shattered me. Joshua didn’t (and still doesn’t) deserve all the hate he got, and no one should go through something like that. I’m glad that he mentioned that his mental heath is a lot better.",en
19,why aren’t these getting more views josh deserves to tell his truth too,en
20,Joshua is on his way of self-acceptance and emotional maturity.,en
21,I can’t stop listening to these. They’re amazing. “Weren’t you the one why left in the first place? Weren’t you the one who called things off? Was it an act to live me or an act to hate me? But don’t you dare act like I didn’t love you…” thank you Joshua. These songs might have honestly helped save my life.,en
22,"I have huge respect for him and his music. As someone who suffers from chronic diseases and mental health issues, seeing and hearing other people share that vulnerable side to them and especially your donation to charity just saddens me (that you have to suffer from mental health issues because of all the drama), and warms my heart. I hope people realize that these artists are also people and that we shouldnt involve ourselves in their personal matters. Stay strong man, and sorry if my english is all over the place.",en
23,"He’s giving me Harry styles, Charlie puth, Shawn mendes along with himself sorta vibes and honestly, I’M LOVING IT",en
24,he’s in his reputation era everyone and he is NOT HOLDING BACK !!!,en
25,"We can all appreciate all the art: Sabrinas, Olivias and Joshuas! They’re all talented and deserve the best ",en
26,"""Messing with my life is a career move""


This is so fucking eleite!",en
27,Reading all the comments about respecting both point of views initially made me think to hell with that because the same energy wasn’t given earlier this year but then I realized that’s the difference between his fans and others. Empathy and respect for the feelings of all parties involved. Truly a testament to Josh and the love he chooses to spread ,en
28,"Joshua really helps me a lot... he speaks out my fears and anxiety in his songs, and they turned out to be beautiful in the form of art",en
29,I feel so bad hes literally getting death threats hes underrated asf and hes talented asf. love you joshua keep drinking water and staying healthy your music is great<3,en
30,"He's very brave, the lyrics are very direct. How could anyone ever hate this guy? I don't think there's any malice in him.",en
31,To be honest I’m on his side he just has such sweet songs.,en
32,"This is one of those songs that nobody can do justice covering, just because it's so loaded with emotions and references that are unique to his situation/experience.",en
33,"Joshua, This song speaks so much about what happened. I'm so, so sorry for everything that happened to you and no one should ever have to go through that:(. I'm very proud of you releasing this because it shows the people who always thought it was your fault that you never got to show your side. Just know that I never hated you from day one and that I'm sorry for everything that happened to you. I hope everyone understands your true feelings .",en
34,"Why are people picking sides?! Both Josh and Oliva are insanely talented people. And don't hate on Josh for releasing this, he deserves a chance to tell his side of the story.",en
35,i read the comments and the fact that nobody is being hateful is amazing. this is a wonderful song and i hope things will get better for him,en
36,“was it an act to hate me or was it an act to love me” THESE LYRICS  I LOVE YOU JOSH,en
37,“And it’s cool if you want me to play the bad guy” omg I couldn’t relate to lyrics more I love all of his songs so ima go and blast them in my room,en
38,"This song is so raw and emocional I love it so much!! I’m so proud of Joshua and his evolution as an artist and person :) it’s not easy to release a song like this one, I can only imagine how vulnerable it makes you feel",en
39,"Aside the fact that his voice is poweful and the song is touching...
I wanna say that the thing that we forget sometimes is that they all are young. They both have the right to creat songs about their feelings and all, but what that turns these songs to a war zone is the way fans act after listening to either one of them. You know this is THEIR lives. Yeah they do write about it but don't hate or annoy any one of them cause at the end of the day the really are just young people still trying to figure out things in their lives. And also, non of our businesses! ",en
40,"I love the music that has come out of this situation, but I feel terrible (at least emotionally) for everyone involved. Especially Josh, cause the support and success Olivia has gotten is crazy in comparison to the hate he (and Sabrina) received.",en
41,The fact that he always kept respectful- even though she put him through all of this- that's so strong and grown up,en
42,They always say there’s 2 sides in every story and as good as olivias songs are i think Josh’s songs gives a whole different perspective on the outside world Im so glad to hear his songs I feel so sorry for what he went through but so happy for him and his music it’s amazing he has my support,en
43,"Maturiting is realizing Joshua being a bad person only happened in her fans' head and none of them deserve hate, but staying silent while your fans are ruining his life and putting his life in danger is enough to be mad at her and writing this song",en
44,"Wow, there can be nothing better than this. You are singing about the fact that your ex is singing songs about hurting and your family is getting phone calls, and you are donating all the money to mental health organizations. He has my 100% support.",en
45,Such a beautiful song..Good job Josh!!,en
46,"I think this song is so interesting, not just because of the lyrics, but because of the musicality and tone as well. It's a breakup song written like a love song which so perfectly conveys his message.",en
47,"You guys wait like I can’t decide if I need to laugh or cry right now. Like the chorus is just so cutting and deep and raw that it literally made me tear up but then “you would never dare to waste a crisis” is just such a good burn and I wanna laugh and high-five him for that one and I’m just… 
Update: I’ve decided to cry",en
48,"Now THIS hits different, he told his side. He didn’t attack her, he kept together and expressed how hurt he was for her to make such songs that put him in a bad position.",en
49,"It's not like I'm invested in their drama, just happened to enjoy both artists.

But I GASPED. THE TEA. HOLY HELL.",en

53,"This song just hits different when you can relate to the situation, we may not be in the spot light but I know anybody who has been in his spot knows what it’s like.. mad respect for him for this masterpiece ",en
54,As an Olivia fan I am so happy he did this. A lot of people need to stop harassing people for being in a relationship that didn’t work out,en
55,"Its such a beautiful song, really. Olivia can write songs about their breakup, its her right. I love her and love Josh too. Nobody should take sides . Both are only young artists and they have all their life in front of them...",en
56,"This song just confirmed for me that, despite what everyone wants to think, they were young and in love. As easy as it is to call one a villain and hating them, chances are they both did things that were wrong and hurtful and they likely also both have grown. No one has to be a bad guy. They were together and now they aren’t and that’s okay. You don’t have to defend them or pick a side, enjoy the art and realize there is probably more than either of them will ever say about how it played out.",en
57,"What a sweet voice to hear. Force! You deserve the best, there are always two sides to a story",en

66,"He's expressing his feelings, and they're valid. He's not calling writing songs a career move. He's talking about not making it end. He's allowed to feel that way.",en
67,Man this was beautiful. I hope your feeling better since you been out of the hospital. Keep your songs coming because this one had my tearing up. I so related to this. I know I am not the only one that can relate to the lyrics,en

71,I’m a big fan of both olivia and josh. I think both deserve the opportunity to release music that tells their story. I hate that some people exasperated the situation so much.,en
72,"""Half the shit you say is only half true, messing with my life is a career move. I can't help but wonder why you won't make it end... cause you would never dare waste a crisis"" - shoutout to Olivia Rodrigo and her idol Taylor Swift. Really makes to reexamine their music or at least how you see it. They're such amazing songwriters so did we all just take their word as gospel because it was tied up in a pretty poetic bow.... Was Olivia the one who dumped him and then wrote a whole album about him being a traitor because he moved on? Cause then all her sassy lines and comments about his therapy are insanely cruel and so is the fact that she sat by and said nothing while she saw all the hate sent to him and Sabrina. And if they talked about therapy did she know that it was because he had been assaulted... Guess the line 'guess that therapy I found for your sexual assault really helped, now you can go and be a better man for your new girl' doesn't flow quite as nice. To be fair Taylor Swift has been demonizing guys who did like minor dick moves most of my life and we all cheered her on.",en

228,"Despite not knowing who Olivia's ex was or what he had done to her, I had always felt sorry for him. Olivia's songs were way too violent and bitter. Joshua's song on the other hand is way more nuanced. You can feel different emotions in the lyrics, sometimes even contradicting each other; like recalling his love for Olivia while at the same time expressing his disappointment with her. Yet there is no aggression whatsoever directed at her. The music is very calm, which contrasts with Olivia's aggressive pop-rock songs (good4u, F**ck you)... kind of like the calm after the storm. The clip is amazing, not a lot of things going on, the focus is on him and his emotions. He isn't putting on a lavish show to get attention. This was a song which truly came from the heart and Joshua comes off as a very honest, talented and kind individual. I don't think a ""damn sociopath"" would've been able to write such a mesmerizing song. I wonder if all his other songs are like this...",en

I just wish there would’ve been a disclaimer somewhere that could have calmed the drama that these songs started…but I guess that was done on purpose and that leaves a bad taste in my mouth as a listener and doesn’t make me want to support the artist if they disrespect an ex they claimed to love. No one deserves this ! Beautiful song ,en

He is doing it because he doesn't want someone to go through what he is, but know it will happen and wants to make it better for others.  Everyone saying this is also a career move, how is this a career move.  He isn't getting any money off of it.  He definitely doesn't want the attention.  Sitting back and doing nothing definitely didn't help him. He has said through out this song that he wants to be done with all of this drama.  Olivia is really the only one at this point who is actually profiting from this, getting attention and the money.  He is literally pleading with her in the song to stop making it worse by doing nothing, just fanning the flames of hate.  Plus that little SNL skit that came out when she performed.  That was real class there.  So childish.  He used his art to express how he feels and told his side because otherwise she was going to control the narrative and did nothing to stop this.",en

390,"Before this song releases, I just want to say a few things after reading the lyrics of the song.
1) All three of them, Joshua, Olivia and Sabrina have labels. All of them. We don't have any idea what's going on behind the scenes but we know artists in general live very controlled lives.
2) Just because joshua says something contradictory to Olivia doesn't mean it has to be false. It could be true. It could be false. It could be somewhere in between. I'm stressing on this. We don't know the story. At all. So, don't demonise any one of the artists because you fancy yourself on a team. Joshua shouldn't be hated for Olivia's lyrics nor olivia for Joshua's. They're both entitled to share their sides of the stories and we don't have to start pointing fingers and accusing one of them of lying.",en

I so love her songs but the truth rings very true in his songs and emotion rings true in hers of course mixed with her catchy lines that every bitter ex feels. Seems pretty probable that she got mad and dumped him hoping he’d come back but instead he met someone else and she flipped out. And here the world is praising the toxic one who let the world attack the boy she repeatedly said she loved and his new girlfriend that he didn’t cheat on her with… shocker it’s 2021 and we have now started celebrating the toxic ones as long as they speak first and can sing good and have Taylor swift song writing vibes… doesn’t matter who tf were destroying in the process ",en

My heart goes out to Josh who had to suffer so much , there is an Indian phrase that you can never clap with one hand , so whatever happened , was not the doing of one person , and again my heart goes out to Josh , no one should get death threats only because they messed up in a relationship , I mean we do to , but we aren’t Celebes , let’s treat the both of them as normal human beings fit once and stop this hate cycle .",en

I felt more heartbroken after this, like the feeling of 'woof, but I'm glad I passed that stage of my life' it's kinda the same feeling as hers...guess that's why they're both not in good terms...yet... but definitely, I don't like how it's cool to be the bad guy (as if you liked it) but I can understand how he feels (as I remember that part of being in a patriarchal society, at the very least).

The fact that people are hating him for that is just disrespectful. Just because they're celebrities does not mean that anyone needs to get involved in their business. Yes Olivia released songs based on Josh and Sabrina, supposedly, and then Sabrina and Josh releasing songs to get back on the haters because people cannot mind their own business and just enjoy the songs. Everyone makes mistakes, should I send you death threats for the mistakes you have made? No. So don't do it to those who are in the public eye either.",en
754,"Honestly, I wasn't really interested in this whole ""Olivia vs. Joshua"" crap. But I listened to her album when it came out and personally while talented, I thought it was boring and for me, that was that. Then I started seeing all the Tiktoks and seeing all the people say, that if they saw him, they'd kill him and that didn't sit right with me. Especially since they acknowledged that he was a kid in those same comments. What sat even worse with me was when I saw people sending Sabrina hate for dating him or whatever.",en
755,"""Fans"" are crazy. He got DEATH THREATS just for having another girlfriend?? Breakups happen all the time, it's not the end of the world. I honestly find Olivia a little too dramatic. Don't get me wrong, she can write great songs and has a beautiful voice, but the drama... was it honestly necessary to release an album to the world telling everyone how ""heartbroken"" she is? 
I loved Joshua's lyrics ""and honestly I didn't wanna write this"". It shows he's not doing this for the publicity. The lyrics are the feelings he just needs to let go of after all he's been through. ""Messing with my life as a career move"" hit hard. His life is being DESTROYED because of this. For goodness sake, just leave the man alone! Is it that important that you hate on someone you don't even know?",en

Something about Olivia was always off to me. She knew of course everyone was connecting drivers license to Joshua and Sabrina. And she never said a word. I assume she definitely knew about the death threats too. But still no word. Until a yr later she tells in an interview that drivers license was never about them. And that ticked me off. One, because I gave a shit about this stupid teen drama but how can u ignore it whens it everywhere and two, because she gave this statement a year later after she baggaged every cent on this ride. I'm sorry but olivia has not been mature during this time. Joshua and Sabrina have been. And if this song is about her, then Joshua sing it mate. Ok, I'm done with this drama now.

That’s just my opinion ;) also remember when in driver license Olivia said Sabrina made her insecure and then Sabrina released her little protest that she’s got the man? LOL hope u keep him",en

994,Good song but hasn’t there been like 4 songs him and the other girl have made about this? We get it y’all are young and let the industry blow up the personal situation. One party took advantage in the moment while the other got paid the price. Time to move on and get some new material.,en

1008,"I’m sorry but the actual song is awful and somebody’s gotta be the one to say it. Good for him for saying his truth but the difference between him and Olivia as songwriters is that Drivers license was symbolic and fans were the ones to figure out her reference. Everyone knows immediately what Josh is referencing cause it’s blatant. Also, Olivia’s music is very relatable. Like who is gonna sing this from their own experience with lyrics like “getting a call from my mom about death threats” or talking about his label? That’s not relatable. The concept of each person telling their own story is something very relatable and I believe could have been beautifully done here, but the difference between what Olivia did with her pain and what Josh did with his is Olivia created a beautiful song full of feeling and emotion that lots can relate to but Josh just sung what he wanted to say. Like bro could’ve just tweeted this song. Sure there was vulnerability and it rhymed but if anything this song was for him and that’s fine but if his music was truly good and I’m not even saying better than Olivia’s or anybody else’s, I’m just saying the music would speak for itself.",en
1009,"I think it’s shitty that he’s saying “do you wonder if I’m okay after all you put me through..”. He dropped her like a hot potato..then he makes this song.  She has every right to make a song about her feelings.  I don’t think she knew he would get death threats, but that’s not her fault.  I don’t think he’s the devil or anything, but that was shitty what he did.  He’s also very young, just like her. They are both profiting from it.  I empathize with her more, but I’m kinda tired of the sad songs.",en
