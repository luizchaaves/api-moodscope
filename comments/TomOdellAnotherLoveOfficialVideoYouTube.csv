And the lyrics are about something important that almost no one talks about. It's not something I can relate to, but I always wondered how people can start a relationship with another person, live for it and then it just ends and they start a new relationship. You end up with a lot of memories about many different people, and in the end you said ""I love you"" to a lot of people too, but that love didn't survive a little trouble. And many times people simply didn't learn how to enjoy time alone and need to be in a relationship all the time, when I always thought it was not an easy thing. It's not a solution to our problems, actually it bring more problems, humans are complicated. Since very young, I always felt like it was not true so I never wanted to make part of it.",en

And while his lover is hurt and angry at him, yelling at him and hitting him, he is stuck in that chair, he cant fight back, not even look at her. I believe that shows how distant and disconnected he is to the relationship... how he feels trapped and incapable of making her stay.
