It is also appearing that Rich has three kids already from three different moms, and word did get out that he's catholic. Besides, you gonna plan a wedding when the Lakers make the playoffs? If you do this, it will not tell some of us in either nation how benevolent you are. This schemer simply does not deserve to know you let alone have you.
