3,"This song is the story of my life, I hate to admit it and say it like this, but I have no friends that I 200% percent trust like normal people have, every group of friends I’ve ever had has extradited me, or just stopped talking to me and suddenly started turning on me unprovoked, I have no one, no song I’ve ever listened to has ever actually made me tear up, this song is a first",en
4,"Love this song because there was a momment of my life this lyrics represented me and I kinda relates at same time I'm happy that I got rid of some ""friends"" and toxic relationships, guys listen, you don't need anyone to be happy or get previous relations as ""knowledge"", every single person is different and yes most of ppl are dick so that's why it seems everyone lies and betrays you, but no, there is someone out there that can be your true friend or partner, you may never get to know eachother but there it is! Today after so many years of having no friends or true lovers, today I have 4 true friends that we have atleast 12 years of true friendship, they aren't following me everywhere I go to, but I know if they need me or I need them we can count on eachother, besides that I got a boyfriend for 4 years now that we have a deep relation just like my friends, but before that I had a toxic boyfriend and ""friends"" that were only interested in my money or for me to doing favors to them, they were no friends tbh and they mocked me and treated me like shit in some ocasions, I felt like I had nobody, but today I have because I didn't let these sentiments to afect how I saw the world or myself and others around me when there was someone. So my tip is: be happy being yourself and be your best friend even if you don't have anybody, maybe they show up someday, maybe not... But if someone show up you'll need to be yourself and not what others made you feel, if nobody shows atleast you've done your very best to be yourself and happy. Screw what other people think and always work on being the best version of yourself. ",en

253,"This song hits really close to home as of recently. I had always tried to be helpful and nice to people so I always offered to help my friends and accepted any asks for help. After covid happened I wasn’t able to see any of them until 2022. A few months ago I moved one city over and now most of them completely cut contact. My mom constantly talks about how she hates me being there and wishes I would just disappear. My family at home always just say man up or to shut up. She hits and hurts me and still gaslights me to make my hate myself for it. Really the only thing keeping me going was my dog Bella and my best friend who is truly the best friend I could ever ask for. But now I haven’t seen most of my friends in over 3 years, my mom just sold Bella and tried to call the police on me to prevent me from hugging my dog one last time. She now prevents me from talking to my dad about it. I just feel like I have been isolated for 3 years with my mom, every day hearing about how stupid I am or how me having adhd means there’s something “wrong” with me. The thing I hate the most about it is that I still try to help her and be nice to her, even if I don’t think she really deserves it, I just feel horrible. I just want her to get therapy so she can get the help she needs. I just want to fix our relationship but she has made it clear she doesn’t care anymore. Now I have very bad trust issues, depression, self hate, and yet my mom still insists that I’m the problem and that the only solution is to give up and get rid of me. I’m sorry for writing a whole book worth of stuff but I don’t really have any outlet to talk about it, anyways please have a good day or night.",en

505,"This song really reminds me of my old 3 best friends. They were so mean and then said they were joking. They were talking behind my back 24/7 and it just made me feel worthless. When I would ask them for help they would just say they were busy. The part of all of this is that, all of there “jokes” really hurt, sometimes I felt like nothing because of them. It made me feel horrible about everything. I tried to stop them but I was powerless, in a never ending loop. It felt like I was drowning in darkness. This song always reminds me of them. When I start ignoring them like they ignored me suddenly I’m the bad guy and the reason they are suicidal. I was the nicest person to all of them. Like what the heck, I didn’t do nothing to them. Yet they self diagnosed themselves with depression because of me. Now it’s all my fault according to them even though they started it. It’s so stupid and I’m scared to tell anyone about it, so now I have really bad trust issues with everyone. I finally found some friends who actually care, but I haven’t told them the full story.

They would start hitting me and telling me to change myself. It didn’t hurt physically when they hit me, but it hurt mentally (I used to get @bus3d as a child.) It took a lot of courage, but I had to break it off. Now I’m lonelier then ever but this music is really helping me get through it. Thanks, Uke.",en

652,"To the person who read this,

It’s been hard for you, I know, and it makes me sad that you don’t see yourself in the way I see you. Sometimes they are things in life that cause us to loose ourselves, and the way you have is so unimaginable painful. I miss your smile, the way your eyes light up the whole room just by the sound of your laughter. I miss the way you accepted the way you look in the mirror without cursing yourself out about how ugly you look. I miss the way you didn’t think of yourself as a failure because everyone makes mistakes, we all have flaws and we all aren’t perfect. It’s painful to see that no one around you seems to see the pain trough your eyes, but, stranger, I do, I see how heavy your heart is and how comforting the sadness for you might be, how afraid your heart is of happiness because it disappears in the end, right? You don’t know how much impact you have in this world and it’s sad to see that your demons fight against you and want to take over you. Because you do make change, it’s something so simple and little that brightens up someone’s whole world, it can be a small smile from your lips, the way you look at things you’re passionate about, the way you make yourself eat even though it’s been hard for you lately, the way you zoom out and go in your own world, you brighten up my world by reading this, it means a lot to me that you’re here, existing, but I don’t want you to just exist, you deserve to feel alive. You deserve to get up in the morning and feel good about yourself. You deserve to feel something- to feel every damn second alive in this lifetime. It’s heartbreaking that you think you’re not capable of being loved, because you are, I love you trough all my words and I hope you let it happen in your heart. Love is scary, I know, maybe you heart had been broken once and since then you wanted to be rather numb than feel ever again, it hurts me how you punish yourself, does it not deserve love? Because YOU DO deserve love, please forgive yourself, it’s not your fault that the demons want to take over your beautiful heart. You’re not a bad person for distancing yourself from others, but you deserve someone to talk to, you deserve someone to listen. I am listening, you can tell me what’s wrong. It’s everything, isn’t it? There’s something pulling your heartstrings on the ground and no one seems to understand how misunderstood you feel, it’s heartbreaking to know that I am behind the screen and can’t give you a hug, that’s why I will give you a big warm virtual hug and send you lots of love :). You matter. You are worthy. You are loved. You deserve good things. You deserve someone to listen. You deserve to eat and drink. You deserve to feel good and alive. You deserve to smile. You deserve a hug. You deserve to be all the things you want to be, because you deserve to have and feel good things happening to you and have a fulfilled life. I know I might not know you personally but I care about you so much, I write this because I want you to stay here with me, I want you to hold on a little longer because you matter so much to me, because I will not let you give up on yourself. I want you to see that you should not give up on yourself because you DESERVE GOOD THINGS. I want you to look back on the time when you were a kid, you didn’t give up when you tried to swim for the first time, you didn’t give up when you tired to walk for the first time and fell, you never gave up on yourself, you always kept on pushing forwards, so why can’t you now? I know it’s tiring, your mentally tired, but dont your younger self deserve good things? look back at your eyes that used to be full of hope, look back on those dreams. Don’t let yourself fall, you deserve better. We will both fight, I will fight for you. I won’t let those demons get to you. You can hold on to me, I won’t let you down :). Whenever you feel lonely, then look at the sky, I always look at it and think about you. Yes, you, because it makes me happy that there’s someone looking right back, maybe we can’t see each other but I can feel your presence here with me and that’s enough for me, because I am glad your heart is beating and you’re still fighting. You’re so much stronger thank you think, you didn’t leave your spot on this earth even if you wanted to, you belong here, even though it doesn’t feel like it, when you don’t feel like belonging than build your own home here, put all your love in it and dreams. Think of you as a star when you feel alone, you shine because your heart is good, no matter what mistake you made, no matter about the past you had, you’re one of the stars that shine bright in the universe because you’re heart is beautiful, that’s why the demons in your mind wants to have it. As one of the stars you see others stars, maybe they have felt the same way as you do at some point in there life, but they lighten up the universe with each other’s presence. You’re a star for me, maybe you don’t see it yourself but I can see it, you’re beautiful from inside and out, your body is beautiful the way it is. You make me happy by reading this, you make me feel something by your presence and when you can make me feel that way than you also make other  people feel that way about you too. I hope you stay for yourself and don’t let your story get written by others but by yourself, it’s your story not theirs. As you can see, I say a lot of “I hope” because I have hope for you even if you don’t have it for yourself, I see hope in you even though you might want to give up. That’s why I hope you won’t see the world in darkness and will see it colorful again, I hope I will give you a glimpse of hope and make the world you see a bit colorful for today. My favorite color is yellow, and I hope the next time you see the color yellow you will think about my words. If someone left you than don’t blame yourself, don’t think you weren’t enough, don’t lower yourself for someone who couldn’t see the awesomeness in you. If you lost someone I am so sorry for your loss, they want you happy, I hope you don’t feel guilty or regret because you were there, you spend enough time with them, they want you to be happy. They are in a good and safe place now. If someone broke your heart than I am so sorry that they couldn’t see the way you look so beautiful because of the heart you have. Anyone who gets to be with you, doesn’t know how fucking lucky he/ she/ they is :). If you aren’t accepted at home or in general than I am so sorry that you have to deal with someone/ something you shouldn’t be ashamed of, I accept you and support you, I accept you as a human being no matter what race, religion, nationality, skin color, or sexuality you have. You’re safe here with me :). You’re not useless, you’re not a burden to anyone. You’re not a problem, you’re human and your feelings are valid. You’re not being dramatic. Please don’t starve yourself, you deserve food and to drink, I know it’s hard. It hurts to see that you’re in so much pain :( you deserve so much man, don’t let your emotions control you. Don’t let them get the best of you.  I am sorry no one is noticing, I wish /hope I could take your pain away for today or even for a moment while you’re reading this. If no one told you, I am so proud of you, you’re reading this and it’s enough for me to be proud of you because you’re here and that’s all that matters to me. If it’s night for you, go to sleep, I know it’s hard to fall asleep right now but you deserve a good sleep. If you have nightmares, please, don’t let them fight you. If it’s day for you, don’t start it by such sad music, I know it’s impossible to have a good day with such mindset but take baby steps, start by drinking two cups of water everyday in the morning and so on.. You will start building little healthy habits. If it’s evening for you, you’re probably overwhelmed and stressed, I want you to know it’s okay to feel the way you feel. You don’t need to be scared, of course you’re overwhelmed or stressed, I mean who wouldn’t? But it’s important to know that when you feel that way you should do a little self care, such as taking a bath for example? You deserve to feel at ease and relaxed. ",en
