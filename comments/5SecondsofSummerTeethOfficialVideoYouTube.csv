That tells us about the dark side of love, love that comes from both sides - but also the deadly honey that drives people crazy.

331,"I’ve got a theory that this song isn’t only about a toxic relationship with a person but also about a toxic relationship with the mind. Each member struggles or is trapped somewhere. For example michael struggles to get up a ladder ( maybe because he’s scared of falling and failure) but he manages to climb up and not doubt himself by looking down. Calum is trapped to a weight and the only way he can free himself is with his bass and music. Ashton is stuck in a tunnel and doesn’t have control over his body, because his fear might be that he is not being able to be himself and express himself freely ( but he manages to push past the things that are trapping him). Luke gets suffocated in a room, maybe because he feels that he doesn’t want to lose himself ( but he also manages to find a doorway to free himself). They all have fears, and they all deal with them in different ways. If u read all of this thanks btw it’s super lonfg",en
