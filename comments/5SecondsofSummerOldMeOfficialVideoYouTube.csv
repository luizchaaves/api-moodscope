Now I have a whole plan for my future and I'm not going to give up on my dreams. I've only just realized that everything I've done since then, was leading up to a career in music and that is insane to me. Thank you 5SOS for teaching me so much about myself.

We all hope to learn from our mistakes (had to f* it up before you really got to know me), but it's tough, because old habits die hard. Some lessons are more costly than others (Whatever the price, I paid...). Kudos to anyone who has the courage to be introspective and learn from their past however long or short it is. Great song. Really nicely done, guys. (My first exposure to 5SOS thanks to Teatime w/Travis.)",en
