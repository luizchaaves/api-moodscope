I've never in my life had a song bring so much emotion to me, and hit me so deeply as this song does.  She passed in November 2021 from this horrible disease, and to this day, I still cry when I hear this song.  My advice to all, is to love everyone with all your heart today, as there is no guarantee of tomorrow.  There is nothing I wouldn't give, to spend one more day with her.  Love you Anna!",en

I have pushed everyone away except my parents. Once they pass I want to die alone. Die alone in my apartment watching It's Always Sunny In Philly or Beavis and Butt-Head. Laugh and drink my life away. The less people I have in my life the less my heart breaks. Cowardly I know, but it makes sense to me. I hope the rest of you out there love everyone close to you and I hope you spend as much time with them as often as you can. Don't forget to tell them how much they mean to you.

I don’t have family besides the one I created myself and they had no idea how to support or even understand what a woman with postpartum depression along with other childhood trauma issues can go thru being at home alone and not being able to go out in the world and socialize once in a while.
