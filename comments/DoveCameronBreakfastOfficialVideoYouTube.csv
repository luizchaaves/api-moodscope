Also, an excellent use of displaying important messages and using your platform for good. Thank you so much Dove!",en
1,The fact that it looks so “wrong” is the fact that it is so beautifully portrayed. I love this woman,en
2,"When she says ""Men are so f-ing emotional, get it together, you know"", she really is shining a light on things other artists aren't doing. Also when she says, "" I never said it was right, but I'm gonna keep doing it"". She knows what she is doing is wrong but still keeps doing it because it gives her power.",en
3,"When the doctor said ""make sure you dress properly so that u won't provoke women""this line hit hard.We women have to listen to this every single day ,when we dress or go out.I would respect those men who understands the message of this song,who u understands what we women go through all the time.",en

7,"I don't understand why MV's like this don't blow up? Like, music which also gives a message, why don't they get much recognition? We need to give grammys to songs and mvs like these which also give a social message.",en
8,"Made me cry, we NEED more people to be speaking up about women's rights
Edit: For the people who are blind, how is birthing a kid against your will fine to you? Or the fact that child marriage is still relevant. The fact that most rape cases go unpunished, always finding a way to blame the woman....you don't care about men's rights if you only bring it up to overshadow women's problems. And that's a fact.",en
9,"Can we talk about the line ""One by one hang on my necklace, they'll always be mine""?
It truly shows that the shit women endure from sexual abuse/harassment never leaves them and men know it and use it as a way to draw their power. Not to mention that most men that act this way, have multiple victims.

51,"This video is handled so well. I love that Dove doesn’t try too hard to paint herself in a positive light. After the initial ‘hah it’s backwards’ you’re not even really rooting for her, it’s actually pretty creepy. The focus on all the subtle power plays- the four on one, the ‘boys are so-‘ in front of one, the touches and the helplessness is perfect. Dove, I didn’t think it was possible, but you’ve outdone yourself.",en

445,"Dove needs an award for this, this is so excellent and truly depicts what women go through every single day, men get to blame women but when the tables are turned they fall. If Andrew Tate saw this ( a misogynist man) he would splutter and spit, because in his little world men are powerful and women are wh03s. Men like him don’t understand what it’s like to have your rights taken away, forced to give birth at the age of 10 or worry about what they wear or walking in the dark. This video is iconic, and a overall masterpiece and is a great video to show young girls all over the world.",en
446,"I get that women also SA men, but men aren’t getting the right to make safe and difficult decisions about their bodies taken away. I honestly don’t think this video is trying to take away from the fact that both men and women get SA’d, but to highlight that it is dehumanizing to take away anyone’s right to choose what they think is best for themselves and their body.

450,"Although I don't completely agree with all of the political statements made in this music video, I think this is an amazing concept. Reversing the roles makes the downright unreasonableness of sexism blatantly obvious and helps those who deny its existence put themselves in the shoes of those who experience it. Although I don't personally agree with the ethics of abortion, I still thing everyone should have access to it. If people don't have a safe way of doing it they will find unsafe ways of getting rid of the baby. For the safety of the mothers, we cannot go back to clothes hangers. Human beings should not be reduced to such an extreme and barbaric solution of solving their problems. Although I think killing a baby is wrong, outright banning abortion is not the solution. A lot of pro life people aren't willing to put themselves in the shoes of someone who has been raped or goes through a teenage pregnancy. They can't imagine how terrifying it must be to have such a traumatic experience and then have such a huge responsibility placed on you all at once. Not to mention the stigma that society places on rape victims and teen moms. To deny them their only solution without offering to solve the problem another way is a horribly apathetic and bigoted thing to do. If you oppose abortion, you should be personally willing to adopt the baby. If you care that much about human life, you should be willing to take care of it. If you aren't willing to take care of it, why should a 15 year old girl have to? I also have a problem with pro choice people. There is nothing ""empowering"" about getting an abortion. Nobody enjoys getting them. Their two options are A: give birth and live in poverty the rest of your life as a single mom or B: kill your baby so your family doesn't disown you and you aren't cripplingly poor. Neither of those options is empowering. A woman should be able to keep her child, and feel prepared to do so. We need to look at why people want abortions and see if we can help them with those things. We can make birth control more accessible. We can teach proper sexual education to children, making sure they understand what consent is. We can offer classes that show young parents how to properly care for their children. We can provide free childcare for them so they can continue their studies. We can improve the foster system. There are so many more positive and effective ways of solving this issue than aborting the baby. Are these solutions more challenging? Yes. But they are so much better than simply trying to morally justify a murder.",en

Edit: I meant that the video was impactful in the sense of showing men how women are often treated badly and I liked the reverse psychology part of the video. It basically made women look bad but also targeted men since they are the ones who usually act like this. Not saying that all men do. It’s an interesting concept that makes you really think about if your right or wrong in this topic. I also feel it sends a strong message that things need to at least change in certain areas.

Or maybe they had the men dressed as men to show that gender bias is more a state of mind?

Movies and videos and songs like this are absolutely amazing, as it gives them a perspective. But god, I wish we could just flip a switch for one goddamn day and be able to not be sexualizex 24/7.

If you want to see a change in how women are percieved stop letting people exploit you by simply not wearing makeup or revealing your body to strangers. I understand how it's mens fault women to do all these things but being able to be naked in the public is not empowering for women you will just get objectified even more and you will further give up your ""power"" to the men. Feminsim lost it's meaning in today's age intead of it progressing its just getting worst and worst, look how big the porn industry and modelling industry is. These industries literally exploit and objectify women yet instead of abolishing them we are telling women that they are empowering because now women get payed more for being involved in them or are not getting coerce or trafficked as much. Is the money worth more over the message?
