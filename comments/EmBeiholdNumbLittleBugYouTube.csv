81,"I agree that it's good to have songs that help you feel understood by other people, so you know you're not alone- I've definitely felt numb before- but I hope this doesn't romanticise just a general attitude of... ingratitude?  I think is the word I'm looking for? The numbness I've felt was a shock response in my body to deal with trauma before self destruction, and I feel I navigated that, gradually, eventually, to a place of balance again. But part of bringing myself out of that numbness was, therapy, yes, but largely reminding myself of what I have, my family, health-- even just seeing the sky each day, the strength to feel at my lowest and still be alive, moving, not.. dead. Every day is a new day, to do- or not to do- things that will improve my life and the lives of those around me- but the point is that each day you have the option of living. And there's hope in life, there's no hope in death. I do hope those who are feeling numb find peace, find small things to be content about. And I say content- not happy, because happiness comes and goes, like sadness, but contentment is deeper. It is a place from which you can appreciate happy moments, and be compassionate with yourself in sad moments. I hope you find contentment. Not necessarily glamorous, sparkly happiness that looks cute on Instagram, but like, real contentment, that you fall asleep at night feeling content, that when the music dies, the party ends, the lights go off, and you're at home- I hope that you are happy to be who you are when no-one is watching ",en

The other part I especially liked was when she was singing with that other guy at the party -- that while challenges can have us feeling isolated, there are ""others at the party,"" so to speak, that are going through similar things.

I made so many changes since then including quitting my job, taking a break and relocating to a new city with a new job and I am genuinely so much happier. This song is honestly a timecapsule to me of that whole period in my life. I appreciate you so much for your talent and feeling brave enough to share your song. This song really does remind us all of how we're not alone in the crippling feeling of isolation that comes with depression.

It became so frequent I was always thinking about it. I broke down multiple times knowing exactly what to do but so afraid of myself and what I might do but at the same time not wanting to live anymore, I was able to listen to this song and relate to it so much It was one of the things that made me feel less alone and more normal since others could and were experiencing this too. Whenever I hear this song now, even though it reminds of one of the toughest times in my life and makes me sad It also reminds me of how I was able to move past it and know that it's very possible that other people can be experiencing it like I did and hide it like I did. To whoever i reading this, whether or not you are struggling just know that I love you, you matter, you are NOT alone, you can beat this just hold on a little longer. ",en

It's exactly how I feel these days. I'm going through so many losses and have a long history of mental health issues and for generations my family has suffered this issue. It's rare to hear a song from this genre that speaks to me but last few years I've been very tired of life but I push through for my youngest son. I've been divorced, older kids grew up and do their own thing now, my youngest son's mom isn't ready to settle down and isn't nice about it. I've lost many friends lately, mostly from drugs and I have no social or love life for 4 years. I'm not excited facing growing old alone and my extended family has passed away or just don't care anymore for anyone. I can't recall a time of such boredom and loneliness and overall helplessness. It's nice to hear a song with such deep meaning that is relevant to my life. It's a good song, catchy and she's a beautiful woman as an added bonus.

And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can‚Äôt forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can‚Äôt be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I‚Äôve come across in my life, and I‚Äôm definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the chip go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the chip is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on chip . hail chip. hail chip . The spinning chip, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the chip spins, showing its lightly salt covered yellow skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the chip scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating chip. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of chip I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of chip I have ever seen especially on ",en

The point of this story cause I'm not gonna sugarcoat it I had a physcotic ex that would do unlawful things and every moment I felt threatened cause we always had gotten in fights and we never had saw eye to eye, in fact we had nothing in common. Fortunately I am not on the bad side for ghosting him I want you to remember that but I did ghost him and nothing has happened to me or at least yet. I always find myself trying anything to forget about him or anything else that leads to him since all it takes is for me to sit down for at least a minute is all it takes for me to think about what could of happened or how ""this"" would result. I've found myself to think about commiting but I never did cause I still had just a little bit of faith yes I know  this may sound cringey but I'm trying to tell a story so please just understand where im going even though i had thoughts I still tried to resist. One day I decided to take the risk and ghost him HOPING nothing would happend yet nothing yet hopefully.

You'll just realize that you're either talking on an empty space or staring at the emptiness. There's more to it than just wanting to die.
