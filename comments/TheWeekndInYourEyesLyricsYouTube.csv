All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). God is holy and the punishment for sin is Hell. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord (Romans 6:23). Jesus Christ is the way, the truth and the life (John 14:6). He died on the cross and rose again on the third day for us all. Repent of your sins, believe in Jesus Christ and accept Him into your heart and follow Him.",en
