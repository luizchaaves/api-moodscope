941,"1. Introduction:

""Dying for an iPhone"" is a powerful and thought-provoking book that delves into the harsh realities of the production of Apple products in China. The book provides an in-depth analysis of the exploitative labor conditions and environmental impacts of producing electronic devices in one of the largest electronics manufacturer factories in the world, Foxconn. The authors argue that multinational corporations like Apple need to take responsibility for their impact on workers and the environment, and provide a compelling case for systemic change that addresses the underlying economic and political structures.",en
