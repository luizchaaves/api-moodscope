I, willingly and in full conscious, gave up on any dream I had or had ever dreamed of having, in reality I gave up everything. We technically grew up together. Over the years, I went on and ended up having 3 more children (all boys) they also have the same disorder but very mild as do I. As she got older she blamed me for all my failures as a mother, ones that I had no idea had to be taught because I had never been taught. You see, I grew up below poor and most of the places my mother moved us to had no electricity, water or much food. It‚Äôs an excuse I realize but I really didn‚Äôt know. ",en

755,"Sorry, but I'm not sure why her voice gets so much praise.  For me, it's like  finger nails being scraped across a chalkboard.  If you've heard one Adele song, you've pretty much heard them all.   The only song by her that I kind of like is ""Send My Love (To Your New Lover)"".  I heard ""Hello"" so much on the radio that whenever I heard it start to play, I would immediately change the channel.  In fact, I do that anytime I hear an Adele song on the radio, with the exception of the one I mentioned above.  On top of all that, most of her songs are depressing and are about relationship problems or failures, in which it sounds like the man is being portrayed as the problem most of the time.  That's typical.   Not interested in this type of music and singing.  I guess I'm spoiled, because I grew up listening to singers like Donna Summer, Olivia Newton-John, Irene Cara, Whitney Houston, Taylor Dayne, Laura Branigan, Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, etc, and I just don't care for Adele's singing voice.",en
