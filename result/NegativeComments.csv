The fact he sings about death threats he got and he’s donating the money off his song to mental health organizations. Yeah he’s got my support 100%;0.194;0.665;0.142;-0.4215
This song is like... so emotional. He got so much hate when olivia's fan didn't even know half the truth. The effect hate can have over one is tremendous, it really really messes with one's mental health and I hope this doesn't happen to anyone ever again. It's completely fine when we love a song, keep vibing with it but it's NEVER OKAY to give death threats or hate someone JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE A FAN!;0.219;0.615;0.166;-0.8831
After SOUR everyone labelled Joshua as the bad guy and people didn't even bother trying to listen to his side of it. I love how he just explains how he's being treated (by fans not Olivia) through his music. The reason he's one of my favourite singers is because his songs are more than just relatable. You can easily find songs everywhere of people saying someone broke up with them and how their hurting but its difficult to find songs that portray the feelings of the one who ended it, the one who's reasons are never heard. So finally being able to find an artist that describes these emotions makes me feel better. I was labelled the bad guy by every single person I knew and no one tried to listen to me. And Joshua's songs always speak for me. He's an underrated artist and he deserves more recognition.;0.102;0.84;0.058;-0.7982
After listening to the Sour album and all of Josh’s songs (and now these 3 new ones) I’m with Josh on this. Both sides need to be heard, and it’s heartbreaking he got death threats. Olivia did some damage. He’s not digging at her here. He’s expressing himself.;0.227;0.773;0.0;-0.9169
“Messing with my life as a career move” damn... he’s awesome. I can’t believe Olivia’s fans sent him death threats... it’s insane. How fucking pathetic could you be to care THAT much about the life of someone you don’t even know.;0.28;0.592;0.127;-0.8313

The fact that Liv did nothing for the death threats and kept the drama going on over and over again just hurts me. I loved both of them so much. I was never picking sides. But this is just making me sad. Making everything about yourself isnt cool. and Liv did exactly that;0.17;0.757;0.073;-0.7202
The lyric at 1:20 about the death threats shattered me. Joshua didn’t (and still doesn’t) deserve all the hate he got, and no one should go through something like that. I’m glad that he mentioned that his mental heath is a lot better.;0.266;0.592;0.142;-0.8074
I feel so bad hes literally getting death threats hes underrated asf and hes talented asf. love you joshua keep drinking water and staying healthy your music is great<3;0.252;0.518;0.23;-0.2479
I love the music that has come out of this situation, but I feel terrible (at least emotionally) for everyone involved. Especially Josh, cause the support and success Olivia has gotten is crazy in comparison to the hate he (and Sabrina) received.;0.207;0.605;0.188;-0.2732
Maturiting is realizing Joshua being a bad person only happened in her fans' head and none of them deserve hate, but staying silent while your fans are ruining his life and putting his life in danger is enough to be mad at her and writing this song;0.276;0.724;0.0;-0.9432
Now THIS hits different, he told his side. He didn’t attack her, he kept together and expressed how hurt he was for her to make such songs that put him in a bad position.;0.244;0.756;0.0;-0.875
"It's not like I'm invested in their drama, just happened to enjoy both artists.

This song just confirmed for me that, despite what everyone wants to think, they were young and in love. As easy as it is to call one a villain and hating them, chances are they both did things that were wrong and hurtful and they likely also both have grown. No one has to be a bad guy. They were together and now they aren’t and that’s okay. You don’t have to defend them or pick a side, enjoy the art and realize there is probably more than either of them will ever say about how it played out.;0.156;0.71;0.134;-0.5719
I’m a big fan of both olivia and josh. I think both deserve the opportunity to release music that tells their story. I hate that some people exasperated the situation so much.;0.164;0.707;0.129;-0.34
"""Half the shit you say is only half true, messing with my life is a career move. I can't help but wonder why you won't make it end... cause you would never dare waste a crisis"" - shoutout to Olivia Rodrigo and her idol Taylor Swift. Really makes to reexamine their music or at least how you see it. They're such amazing songwriters so did we all just take their word as gospel because it was tied up in a pretty poetic bow.... Was Olivia the one who dumped him and then wrote a whole album about him being a traitor because he moved on? Cause then all her sassy lines and comments about his therapy are insanely cruel and so is the fact that she sat by and said nothing while she saw all the hate sent to him and Sabrina. And if they talked about therapy did she know that it was because he had been assaulted... Guess the line 'guess that therapy I found for your sexual assault really helped, now you can go and be a better man for your new girl' doesn't flow quite as nice. To be fair Taylor Swift has been demonizing guys who did like minor dick moves most of my life and we all cheered her on.";0.139;0.723;0.138;-0.4962

Josh has beautiful wording in this song, yes Olivia went through a lot too but nobody realizes that Olivia put Josh in a lot of pain. He got send death threats, and was getting shamed for things that may not be true. He didn’t get to share his side of the story. I mean even though people were commenting that he is rude for writing about this 11 months later, but did anyone think about the fact that he was getting bullied, shamed for everything. It was his time to share his side and to me he was in a lot of pain. I love him for that, I believe him more than Olivia. Josh, be proud for who you are, and what you did!;0.239;0.645;0.116;-0.9772

As much as I know everyone uses breakups and situations of the like to help their career and maybe even grow as a person, it must feel really.....bad to find out that someone's life is being threatened just because of an album you put out. I think it would be beneficial for everyone to realize that the people writing these songs might not be as hurt by the situation as it might seem, so death threats are so unnecessary at all times. Especially over just an average breakup.;0.108;0.787;0.106;-0.2945

I feel bad supporting Olivia Rodrigo's singing career now. She can write whatever song that she wants, but people were sending death threats to Joshua Bassett. She has never talked to her fans, nor has she tried to talk to him. She just let it all happen.;0.201;0.764;0.035;-0.8847

Waw, this hits differently....it amazes me how some can give hate and the out come after pain could be so touching yet sad at the same time. This whole some could be taken in many ways.

As am artist. You use your art to express yourself.  If it's true that he is donating the proceeds from this to a charity focusing on mental health.  He is doing it because he doesn't want someone to go through what he is, but know it will happen and wants to make it better for others.  Everyone saying this is also a career move, how is this a career move.  He isn't getting any money off of it.  He definitely doesn't want the attention.  Sitting back and doing nothing definitely didn't help him. He has said through out this song that he wants to be done with all of this drama.  Olivia is really the only one at this point who is actually profiting from this, getting attention and the money.  He is literally pleading with her in the song to stop making it worse by doing nothing, just fanning the flames of hate.  Plus that little SNL skit that came out when she performed.  That was real class there.  So childish.  He used his art to express how he feels and told his side because otherwise she was going to control the narrative and did nothing to stop this.;0.093;0.821;0.085;-0.4218

It’s honestly disgusting that Olivia did not speak up and tell her fans to stop sending Joshua death threats. Regardless of whatever happened in their relationship (because none of us really know), she was profiting off those songs and the narrative that Josh was in the wrong, which led to him getting death threats from her fans….

Guys , both his and olivia’s songs are equally heartfelt , what people don’t understand is that a relationship is much more complex and complicated than just a few lines in songs , so we can’t take sides here , both of them hurt , took wrong and right decisions for one another , this hate cycle needs to stop , that are just songwriters who are expressing their feelings , I doubt they want to call out one another , the part where people said that Olivia wasn’t defending Josh , I think with Lane constraints she was only able to speak very little about that , I mean everyone knows how much production companies have power over artists , but I’m not trying to defend anyone here or pick sides , they both are so so talented . My heart goes out to Josh who had to suffer so much , there is an Indian phrase that you can never clap with one hand , so whatever happened , was not the doing of one person , and again my heart goes out to Josh , no one should get death threats only because they messed up in a relationship , I mean we do to , but we aren’t Celebes , let’s treat the both of them as normal human beings fit once and stop this hate cycle .;0.133;0.751;0.115;-0.2883

But I even love Joshua more after I listen DL song , I didn’t hate him, I became his fan. Poor Joshua, I am so sorry for him.";0.261;0.572;0.167;-0.6009

The Label also asked Sara Bareilles to write another song.  She wrote the song about NOT writing another love song.;0.151;0.849;0.0;-0.5216
His label was right about him putting out good music, but should never have tried forcing him to respond to drama. His facial expressions show his pain and frustration about this whole situation. The makeup artist represents his label trying to get him ready, but he is not thinking about responding but his feelings about the complete situation. He looks so done with this entire situation and hates that he gets all the hate. He doesn't know what to say because everyone is making up his side for him. His voice is truly beautiful, and he should get recognition for his talent and not the drama surrounding him.;0.13;0.736;0.134;-0.1027
"DON'T SPREAD HATE if you can't Love means. 

Olivia should have asked fans not to spread hate considering people were sending death threats to Joshua. Writing, making songs is not bad, but the people who take it too far and indulge in cyber bullying should be held accountable.";0.201;0.694;0.105;-0.7711
Joshua has been put through so much through this whole process and the fact that he got death threats and that Olivia is saying crap about him that isn’t true I feel so bad for him and he definitely has my support. His songs give you a whole other outlook on what is happening;0.2;0.681;0.119;-0.7644
i understand thinking olivias songs are about him, but going as far as to HATE him for it is just wrong. when her songs first came out i thought they were about him too but i would NEVER send him death threats. i knew from the start that her songs are only half the story. i love her music but people need to realize that those songs are from her point of view. i know it’s hasn’t even been a whole year but i’m glad i’ve matured enough to realize that joshua isn’t a bad guy. he’s was just as much a part of that relationship as she was and he deserves to express his feelings on it.;0.13;0.772;0.098;-0.6937
love people supporting him in the comments but we’ve got to remember that he doesn’t want anyone hating on olivia either;0.162;0.619;0.219;-0.1154
Maybe his label was right. I mean I would rather have it be he lacks inspiration and have a happy life but at least he’s using what he’s been through as a positive experience. Everyone just jumped on him and made him out to be the villain in all this when she’s the one who write the song and from what I could see didn’t stop her fans from sending him hate. He put out these songs and made it very clear not to hate on her. He made it clear that anyone who hates on his behalf is not a fan. I didn’t see her doing that. It’s a shame because you can have fame but if your souls ugly it means nothing.;0.17;0.678;0.151;-0.6257

I thought there was no way people would see what was really happening, but I think this song might be the key;0.071;0.929;0.0;-0.1531
I think that they both hurt each other but Olivia took advantage of it and made it art but it backfired both positive and negative. Olivia exaggerated what happened threw her song and added self enterpretations that made it worse.;0.239;0.625;0.136;-0.6808

Like I always say that music is when one sings with his own personal feelings and heart on how he/she feels and a relationship begins with two ppl and ends with two ppl, idk some ppl do love a celeb , loves their music is fine but what is all this? U're hating a person, criticising him, making his life hell, giving him death threats is this what music all about, if a person is hurt it's ok to sympathize them but what's all this shit? Some ppl r seriously psychopaths we dk what the other person is going through, atleast u can't love but don't hate and make other life miserable and the person whom u're doing too doesn't want this I feel, nobody wants to be a murderer atleast;0.293;0.596;0.112;-0.9909
Honestly, Olivia made everything worse by saying most of the lies and Joshua over here is trying to fix everything, and she's just acting selfish.;0.278;0.631;0.09;-0.7402
But she didn’t name names so I don’t see why she’s getting hate in the headlines? People speculated like they always do and raised problems via social media, but her songs are ours, like Taylor Swift says - they are our stories. ️;0.156;0.687;0.157;-0.2263
its so clear that the pain she caused him (ruined reputation, death threats, harassment, public humiliation) is so much worse than whatever he did to her (moved on from her in private), yet she plays the victim and paints him as the bad guy.;0.436;0.491;0.073;-0.9761

calling olivia out as he should. the fact people see her as a victim when she’s the one who exposed a private relationship bc of a clear agenda and hatred for sabrina, and saw them as villains for simply having a relationship like any other person is so weird bc him and olivia were long broken up at the time. the person that let other ppl get bullied and harrased until one nearly died(hell shes crazy she probably wanted it to happen) is more loved than the people who got bullied and harassed for no reason? keep in mind she didn’t even go online and tell her fans to stop ? doesn’t matter if it wouldn’t have helped it would have shown she cared about peoples mental health and well-being, especially someone she claimed to love ;0.211;0.688;0.101;-0.9572
Don’t understand how people could dislike this;0.302;0.698;0.0;-0.3818
i swear to god if this isn't going viral! he didn't deserve all the hate he got and can finally tell his story.;0.19;0.733;0.077;-0.4753

I can’t stop watching this video. You can feel his emotions, they are genuine.;0.145;0.855;0.0;-0.296
although i love Olivia, it doesn’t justify that she was in the wrong, yes as an artist she is allowed to express her feelings but letting her friends/family add on to the drama was so wrong and her saying that she thinks is funny is also wrong, she could of spoken up but instead she waited until it died out to finally speak about it because the drama was benefiting her career, even after all she put Josh through, he was still supportive of her music and would always post about it to his instagram saying positive things, this is not 100% Olivias fault, we all need to learn how to be nice to one another regardless of what happened, bullying and death threats are NEVER ok to anyone!;0.197;0.67;0.133;-0.9328

Well, he is right and i feel so bad for all the hate that he got and still getting, even if Olivia's songs are about him, that doesn't mean you have to put him in hell like he is not a human like us and not only him all the famous people are like us with feelings and emotions, they deserve respect and privacy.;0.184;0.69;0.126;-0.7718

Lets stop hating people and just appreciate this song .;0.362;0.461;0.178;-0.4215
I’m so sorry for all he went through. But after all the one’s to blame are the fans, I don’t get why everyone has to hate on someone just because had some misunderstanding with their preferred artist. I don’t know if this is about Liv, but I do know that I was heartbroken with Sour BUT NEVER hated on Joshua bc idk if it’s about him. At the end they’re the only ones who know the whole side of the story;0.209;0.746;0.046;-0.9446
Whatever said, I think it was Olivia’s responsibility to address her fans and tell them not to spread hatred and death threats atleast!!;0.238;0.652;0.11;-0.6015
I've lost hope in this generation. This man did not deserve death threats for anything, let alone for lyrics in a song that is not confirmed facts. The need to spread hate for little things that don't even really impact your life in anyway is actually disgusting. Olivia told her story, and so Joshua is telling his. The fact that people are hating him for that is just disrespectful. Just because they're celebrities does not mean that anyone needs to get involved in their business. Yes Olivia released songs based on Josh and Sabrina, supposedly, and then Sabrina and Josh releasing songs to get back on the haters because people cannot mind their own business and just enjoy the songs. Everyone makes mistakes, should I send you death threats for the mistakes you have made? No. So don't do it to those who are in the public eye either.;0.166;0.753;0.08;-0.9363
"Honestly, I wasn't really interested in this whole ""Olivia vs. Joshua"" crap. But I listened to her album when it came out and personally while talented, I thought it was boring and for me, that was that. Then I started seeing all the Tiktoks and seeing all the people say, that if they saw him, they'd kill him and that didn't sit right with me. Especially since they acknowledged that he was a kid in those same comments. What sat even worse with me was when I saw people sending Sabrina hate for dating him or whatever.";0.189;0.756;0.055;-0.95
"""Fans"" are crazy. He got DEATH THREATS just for having another girlfriend?? Breakups happen all the time, it's not the end of the world. I honestly find Olivia a little too dramatic. Don't get me wrong, she can write great songs and has a beautiful voice, but the drama... was it honestly necessary to release an album to the world telling everyone how ""heartbroken"" she is? 
I loved Joshua's lyrics ""and honestly I didn't wanna write this"". It shows he's not doing this for the publicity. The lyrics are the feelings he just needs to let go of after all he's been through. ""Messing with my life as a career move"" hit hard. His life is being DESTROYED because of this. For goodness sake, just leave the man alone! Is it that important that you hate on someone you don't even know?";0.164;0.681;0.156;-0.3627
I never took Olivia's side. Did not know who she was and did not know anything about Joshua or Sabrina until driver's license popped up. And tbh I never liked that song. Something about Olivia was always off to me. She knew of course everyone was connecting drivers license to Joshua and Sabrina. And she never said a word. I assume she definitely knew about the death threats too. But still no word. Until a yr later she tells in an interview that drivers license was never about them. And that ticked me off. One, because I gave a shit about this stupid teen drama but how can u ignore it whens it everywhere and two, because she gave this statement a year later after she baggaged every cent on this ride. I'm sorry but olivia has not been mature during this time. Joshua and Sabrina have been. And if this song is about her, then Joshua sing it mate. Ok, I'm done with this drama now. God forbid I ever come bck to it ;0.164;0.813;0.023;-0.9802

When she was talking shit about him in her songs. Fans: let’s kill him!!!! When he answers back. Fans: let’s be civil, there is always 2 sides of a story  hypocrites ;0.246;0.754;0.0;-0.8877
is it ironic, he wrote a song for other girl when he's with olivia but then he write many songs for olivia when he's with that girl, cmiiw;0.044;0.956;0.0;-0.0644
everyone is so bully;0.578;0.422;0.0;-0.6269
All these songs are good but Joshua Bassett is terrible at lip syncing in the video ;0.206;0.697;0.097;-0.4939
He is suffering from heart failure Olivia needs to lay off;0.344;0.43;0.226;-0.296
olivia is shit for not stopping her fans from making his life so miserable, making fun of his therapy in her songs all that simply for her career move. waiting for karma to hit hard.;0.207;0.68;0.113;-0.6259
OK listen I know Olivia did this to Joshua but Joshua went through it this stuff and I don’t think Olivia should go to YouTube so like we shouldn’t talk crap and send death threats to Olivia;0.245;0.63;0.125;-0.7976
Serious! DEATH THREATS for dating her I feel so bad for him I see Olivia in a whole new perspective after these songs came out joshoua if you see this comment you are in the right and don’t take it personally there just jelly;0.263;0.737;0.0;-0.9354
Girls man they just mess up with u;0.263;0.737;0.0;-0.3612
Olivias song made me angry, Josh’s made me sad;0.478;0.522;0.0;-0.7506
Everyone’s mad that no one told people to stop speculating but at the end of the day it’s not either song writers job to mess with drama people make about their songs it just feeds it really. It sucks that he got death threats but I don’t think telling people not to would have made it stop it would have just made the drama even bigger;0.293;0.707;0.0;-0.9722
"2010 John Mayer couldn't relate, haha.

sorry if this was a bad joke. no hate here";0.256;0.47;0.274;-0.1431
You know whoever sent him death threats next time get the whole damn story cause y'all are fucked for ever telling anyone that you'll kill them or for them to kill themselves honestly if payed attention to Olivia's posts at one point she posted a song for a day or so admitting that she over exaggerated like a month after driver's license so stop being so caught up in drama that you send people death threats that's the most fucked up thing anyone can possibly do so stop it's not cool or funny at all regardless of who you support;0.336;0.605;0.06;-0.9898
Unpopular opinion:Please don’t hate me but oliva has gone to far first she still songs and then she makes a whole song about heartbreak a bunch of people are coming after Joshua Bassett with desperate while he was in the hospital and had a 30% chance of living seriously Olivia that is messed up and buy that blonde girl line in drivers license somehow Sabrina got dragged into all of this I’m lmean but this is just my opinion i’m not saying Olivia did this on purpose but it’s just the assumption;0.161;0.815;0.024;-0.9231
Olivia Rodrigo is a bad person I can’t believe I looked up to her;0.212;0.788;0.0;-0.5423
im sorry for you and olivia she is very rude and ruind your life;0.277;0.723;0.0;-0.5563
Diametrically opposed albums telling very vague two sides of the story. I must say this is a very ugly break up;0.218;0.782;0.0;-0.647

Joshua i cant help wonder why you never made a song with sabrina also pleaseplease get back together with olovia you guys belong together just talk about it work it out;0.07;0.93;0.0;-0.3089
Olivia’s driver’s license is not even a direct attack to Josh nor Sabrina, it’s just her telling a story that’s so vague to who it refers to. But this song is like literally pointing onto somebody. Petty.;0.136;0.787;0.078;-0.1111
You're messin' with my life as a career move... Lmaoo why is he blaming Olivia when he is litterally doing the same thing Don't y'all think its rude to say smth like that;0.16;0.775;0.065;-0.5719
He did not love her he left her Olivia hurt the most he literally cheated on Olivia also all the things Olivia said were true!;0.309;0.61;0.081;-0.8327
I think it’s shitty that he’s saying “do you wonder if I’m okay after all you put me through..”. He dropped her like a hot potato..then he makes this song.  She has every right to make a song about her feelings.  I don’t think she knew he would get death threats, but that’s not her fault.  I don’t think he’s the devil or anything, but that was shitty what he did.  He’s also very young, just like her. They are both profiting from it.  I empathize with her more, but I’m kinda tired of the sad songs.;0.204;0.689;0.106;-0.9334
Blah blah stop trying to gaslight her;0.556;0.444;0.0;-0.4588
It's so cringe how desperately he's trying to ride Olivia's wave now that it's obviously way too late;0.144;0.856;0.0;-0.4336
