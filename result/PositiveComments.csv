“Momma called cause she heard I got death threats” being a mom of 3 boys this hit my heart!! I felt that so much us mothers only want our babies to be safe and happy and loved :( This is a beautiful song;0.109;0.562;0.329;0.9285
A lot of people compare early Taylor Swift to Olivia but I honestly think Joshua compares more to later Taylor.. the maturity in his songs and the stunning guitar reflects the sombre emotion of somebody who has been trampled over but doesn’t want to take revenge.;0.082;0.734;0.184;0.5647
"""but you sensationalise, keep fanning the fire for the headlines."" SO GOOD. His songwriting skills omg.";0.124;0.561;0.315;0.7757
Joshua definitely wins this one. He’s actually expressing his emotions and explaining his side instead of blaming the other person.;0.12;0.639;0.241;0.4939
This song never gets old. No matter how much I listen, I never get bored.;0.068;0.818;0.114;0.1877
"I think it was extremely wise of him to wait to release this. At the time all the drama popped off, his side would have been irrelevant. The fans were raging and painting him as the villain. Now that the dust has settled and the emotions have passed, we can all hear him clearly. I respect him a lot for this. He shared the part of the music industry we never get to hear about. He straight up addressed how that situation affected him and all without having to do any interviews lol. I hope when he's asked about this again in the future, he can point to this song and just say ""Listen to this."" and leave it at that.";0.071;0.791;0.138;0.8553
I remember being so worried for Joshua earlier in the year after all the drama. All the hate towards him was so horrible. People will grow apart from others and that's understandable, so I never hated him when Olivia released those songs. I hope he's doing alright now. This is also such a beautiful song too :);0.146;0.649;0.204;0.5226
just the fact hes donating 100% of it to mental health charities is so f*cking nice this man is so f*ucking kind;0.0;0.656;0.344;0.8737
I felt this… so real and authentic. Joshua shouldn’t be compared with any other artist, I think he has his own sound and aesthetic. Talent.;0.0;0.896;0.104;0.4215
His side of the story is just as relevant as Olivia's. I hope everyone that listened to drivers license and SOUR also hears this;0.0;0.888;0.112;0.4404
this song is so good! he didn’t talk about the breakup in an aggressive way, he was calm, and made his points very clear! and didn’t give him all the credit, bc he knew that he wasn’t perfect too. “don’t go thinking i didn’t hurt too.” is so so sweet! and i love how he is donating all of the profits for charity for mental health crisis’s! he could’ve bought stuff for himself, but no! he has my side! ;0.038;0.74;0.221;0.9305

Joshua is on his way of self-acceptance and emotional maturity.;0.0;0.849;0.151;0.1531
I can’t stop listening to these. They’re amazing. “Weren’t you the one why left in the first place? Weren’t you the one who called things off? Was it an act to live me or an act to hate me? But don’t you dare act like I didn’t love you…” thank you Joshua. These songs might have honestly helped save my life.;0.049;0.658;0.292;0.9705
I have huge respect for him and his music. As someone who suffers from chronic diseases and mental health issues, seeing and hearing other people share that vulnerable side to them and especially your donation to charity just saddens me (that you have to suffer from mental health issues because of all the drama), and warms my heart. I hope people realize that these artists are also people and that we shouldnt involve ourselves in their personal matters. Stay strong man, and sorry if my english is all over the place.;0.112;0.677;0.211;0.8834

We can all appreciate all the art: Sabrinas, Olivias and Joshuas! They’re all talented and deserve the best ;0.0;0.588;0.412;0.8883
Reading all the comments about respecting both point of views initially made me think to hell with that because the same energy wasn’t given earlier this year but then I realized that’s the difference between his fans and others. Empathy and respect for the feelings of all parties involved. Truly a testament to Josh and the love he chooses to spread ;0.036;0.694;0.27;0.9595
Joshua really helps me a lot... he speaks out my fears and anxiety in his songs, and they turned out to be beautiful in the form of art;0.128;0.68;0.192;0.5095
To be honest I’m on his side he just has such sweet songs.;0.0;0.636;0.364;0.743
This is one of those songs that nobody can do justice covering, just because it's so loaded with emotions and references that are unique to his situation/experience.;0.0;0.884;0.116;0.5267
Joshua, This song speaks so much about what happened. I'm so, so sorry for everything that happened to you and no one should ever have to go through that:(. I'm very proud of you releasing this because it shows the people who always thought it was your fault that you never got to show your side. Just know that I never hated you from day one and that I'm sorry for everything that happened to you. I hope everyone understands your true feelings .;0.082;0.788;0.129;0.7593
Why are people picking sides?! Both Josh and Oliva are insanely talented people. And don't hate on Josh for releasing this, he deserves a chance to tell his side of the story.;0.0;0.771;0.229;0.822

“And it’s cool if you want me to play the bad guy” omg I couldn’t relate to lyrics more I love all of his songs so ima go and blast them in my room;0.081;0.675;0.244;0.7165
This song is so raw and emocional I love it so much!! I’m so proud of Joshua and his evolution as an artist and person :) it’s not easy to release a song like this one, I can only imagine how vulnerable it makes you feel;0.074;0.683;0.244;0.8994
"Aside the fact that his voice is poweful and the song is touching...
I wanna say that the thing that we forget sometimes is that they all are young. They both have the right to creat songs about their feelings and all, but what that turns these songs to a war zone is the way fans act after listening to either one of them. You know this is THEIR lives. Yeah they do write about it but don't hate or annoy any one of them cause at the end of the day the really are just young people still trying to figure out things in their lives. And also, non of our businesses! ";0.054;0.864;0.082;0.5264
The fact that he always kept respectful- even though she put him through all of this- that's so strong and grown up;0.0;0.734;0.266;0.8042
They always say there’s 2 sides in every story and as good as olivias songs are i think Josh’s songs gives a whole different perspective on the outside world Im so glad to hear his songs I feel so sorry for what he went through but so happy for him and his music it’s amazing he has my support;0.018;0.715;0.266;0.9656
Wow, there can be nothing better than this. You are singing about the fact that your ex is singing songs about hurting and your family is getting phone calls, and you are donating all the money to mental health organizations. He has my 100% support.;0.097;0.779;0.124;0.3387
Such a beautiful song..Good job Josh!!;0.0;0.527;0.473;0.6688
I think this song is so interesting, not just because of the lyrics, but because of the musicality and tone as well. It's a breakup song written like a love song which so perfectly conveys his message.;0.0;0.598;0.402;0.9735
"You guys wait like I can’t decide if I need to laugh or cry right now. Like the chorus is just so cutting and deep and raw that it literally made me tear up but then “you would never dare to waste a crisis” is just such a good burn and I wanna laugh and high-five him for that one and I’m just… 
Update: I’ve decided to cry";0.091;0.7;0.208;0.8706

As an Olivia fan I am so happy he did this. A lot of people need to stop harassing people for being in a relationship that didn’t work out;0.151;0.662;0.187;0.3272
Its such a beautiful song, really. Olivia can write songs about their breakup, its her right. I love her and love Josh too. Nobody should take sides . Both are only young artists and they have all their life in front of them...;0.0;0.765;0.235;0.9231

The fact that his label told him to release these 3 songs 6 months ago and take maximum advantage of the situation so that he'll get More fame but Josh said no because he didn't want to fuel the fire in the drama more than it already was created by the press just shows what a good human being he is, he waited for all the negativity to go down so that ppl can listen to his story with a calm mind and that tells you how classy and mature he is!!! ;0.102;0.71;0.187;0.8638

"Despite not knowing who Olivia's ex was or what he had done to her, I had always felt sorry for him. Olivia's songs were way too violent and bitter. Joshua's song on the other hand is way more nuanced. You can feel different emotions in the lyrics, sometimes even contradicting each other; like recalling his love for Olivia while at the same time expressing his disappointment with her. Yet there is no aggression whatsoever directed at her. The music is very calm, which contrasts with Olivia's aggressive pop-rock songs (good4u, F**ck you)... kind of like the calm after the storm. The clip is amazing, not a lot of things going on, the focus is on him and his emotions. He isn't putting on a lavish show to get attention. This was a song which truly came from the heart and Joshua comes off as a very honest, talented and kind individual. I don't think a ""damn sociopath"" would've been able to write such a mesmerizing song. I wonder if all his other songs are like this...";0.071;0.72;0.21;0.9833
He's such an angel. When he's singing about this he also goes and donates 100% of his earnings to mental health organizations. I wish I could be this amazing. Love you;0.0;0.711;0.289;0.9081
Will there be a behind the scenes of this music video? I'd love to see it;0.0;0.781;0.219;0.6369
I didn’t even know him before all the songs came out about him and I feel like everyone was talking about it…I don’t even care that much about celebrities but their marketing strategy (if there was one ofc there was one right ?) definitely worked. I just wish there would’ve been a disclaimer somewhere that could have calmed the drama that these songs started…but I guess that was done on purpose and that leaves a bad taste in my mouth as a listener and doesn’t make me want to support the artist if they disrespect an ex they claimed to love. No one deserves this ! Beautiful song ;0.081;0.695;0.223;0.9615
Idk if u agree, but I think that both Olivia and him (if this was abt each other) were  expressing themselves, it’s fans the ones who decided to create such a big drama. And yes Olivia didn’t stop them, but I think that she has become mature now. And Joshua did such an amazing job with this song <33;0.055;0.714;0.231;0.9306

"Something about the shot of him in the pink suit and white flowy backy drop and guitar when he sings ""my label said to never waste a crisis but here I am with a guitar in my hand"" felt super familiar and it seems similar to the structured pink backdrop with a guitar in a suit in the middle of nowhere in lie, lie, lie. It almost felt like a call of saying lie lie lie was a label move to try and get a song into the narrative of the love triangle. When he released lie lie lie the other two had released drivers license and skin.";0.012;0.81;0.177;0.9703

Absolutely. Both sides can tell their story and they can put it into music for us, and that’s their choice. Our job as fans and listeners is to enjoy the music and let them express their feelings and thoughts of the situation. It isn’t our job to get involved in their personal lives. At the end of the day they are both human beings and deserve to be able to tell their side without others criticizing them and telling them how they should feel. There is no right or wrong for us to decide. Love both of their music, and wish both of them nothing but the best with their careers! ;0.051;0.864;0.085;0.2551

"Before this song releases, I just want to say a few things after reading the lyrics of the song.
1) All three of them, Joshua, Olivia and Sabrina have labels. All of them. We don't have any idea what's going on behind the scenes but we know artists in general live very controlled lives.
2) Just because joshua says something contradictory to Olivia doesn't mean it has to be false. It could be true. It could be false. It could be somewhere in between. I'm stressing on this. We don't know the story. At all. So, don't demonise any one of the artists because you fancy yourself on a team. Joshua shouldn't be hated for Olivia's lyrics nor olivia for Joshua's. They're both entitled to share their sides of the stories and we don't have to start pointing fingers and accusing one of them of lying.";0.079;0.831;0.09;0.2148
This guy has my support!!! Olivia was just tryna write like Taylor Swift ;0.0;0.559;0.441;0.783
Difference is that Olivia’s come from a place of anger, resentment, and revenge and his come from a place of depression, confusion, and acceptance of both his and her mistakes in their relationship. I so love her songs but the truth rings very true in his songs and emotion rings true in hers of course mixed with her catchy lines that every bitter ex feels. Seems pretty probable that she got mad and dumped him hoping he’d come back but instead he met someone else and she flipped out. And here the world is praising the toxic one who let the world attack the boy she repeatedly said she loved and his new girlfriend that he didn’t cheat on her with… shocker it’s 2021 and we have now started celebrating the toxic ones as long as they speak first and can sing good and have Taylor swift song writing vibes… doesn’t matter who tf were destroying in the process ;0.175;0.612;0.213;0.9047

I truly believe that Olivia doesn't really care about anyone but herself. I just hope she learns from all of this.  As someone with a voice, she didn't use it. She let things escalate as though she wanted it to happen. She didn't do anything to stop it.  I think it was honestly vindictive and malicious.  As much as I liked her album, and she had every right to release it, she turned a blind eye to the consequences of her actions and people got hurt because of it.;0.12;0.754;0.126;0.16

I'm so looking forward to more of Joshua's music, he's so damn talented. His voice is so underrated, and I really can't wait to see him achieve so many things. Remember art is a sort of expression for a lot of people, so people use music to deal with things. And one more thing, we have no idea what went down, we have no idea of anyone's side, so let's just enjoy those masterpieces and do just that.;0.087;0.796;0.117;0.5648

If yall dont know Joshua broke Olivias heart so people were super mad at him while he was extremely sick an only had a few percentage chance that he could live while Olivia didnt do anything to help Joshua and stop the hate for him. In fact she also wrote the song Good 4 U  About Joshua and people even treatened him and said if they saw him on the streets, they would take his life for doing that to Olivia. No hate to Olivia or Joshua;0.115;0.691;0.194;0.8225

yes, yes her songs are good but also she just blames him. she just made everyone think it was only his fault, while he was so much more mature, he wrote about HIS FEELINGS, and DIDNT BLAME HER. he just wrote about his side of the story, not just “u hurt me, it’s ur fault, ur happy, i’m feeling miserable!” Josh, WE LOVE U!

"""my label said to never waste a crisis"" also seemed like a scene where the boss is like saying to him ""I advise you to write/sing about 'it' too"". Well I guess they're right lol. I might not like the artist well and how the song seems like at first (I mean I really don't know him until I heard the lyrics I knew then who that person 'could' be) but def. liked the song. Hope this will end the drama (and sensationalizing of strangers), but to be honest, I feel like this song is for only one person and a one time like when a groom sings and everyone all see clearly that it's for his bride in that one time...yeah...Also, got me thinking if I should not waste a crisis as well... don't know that yet tho. I felt more heartbroken after this, like the feeling of 'woof, but I'm glad I passed that stage of my life' it's kinda the same feeling as hers...guess that's why they're both not in good terms...yet... but definitely, I don't like how it's cool to be the bad guy (as if you liked it) but I can understand how he feels (as I remember that part of being in a patriarchal society, at the very least). But beside that, this song is unique...I must say.";0.066;0.696;0.238;0.9914

As much as the situation of this all likely sucked for him, I will say the album he's just released is significantly better than his past work. I always tried to enjoy the other stuff but this is music that I would choose to listen to on repeat, and his voice and quality has grown immensely.

You know you get some of those people who you can instantly know they are good people. I am sorry to say she isn't one of them. And messing with Joshua's career just because its good for her career isn't okay. She's just being bitchy right now and acting like a seven yr old. I mean grow up Olivia! ;0.113;0.744;0.142;0.648

I admire how he could sing all of these things and in an absolutely beautiful way. He inspires me a lot to speak my feelings singing too and apart from the drama the songs are so good and real.

It's pretty typical that one person hurts more from a break up than the other. It's brutal. I understand how painful it must have been for Olivia to see Joshua move on to another relationship rather quickly. But she definitely could have and SHOULD have spoken out against her fans who were threatening Joshua's life, as soon as she heard about it. She may have spoken out a bit (I'm unsure) but she had the ability to try to calm her fans down and try to protect his reputation. Seems like more could have been done on Olivia's side. And perhaps Joshua could have waited longer to start seeing someone else - to protect Olivia's feelings.  They produced such emotional and beautiful music from this situation, and there are always lessons to be learned from any situation - so good came from it!  And hopefully others will learn from this too! God bless you all;0.07;0.706;0.223;0.9844
josh is so talented and these lyrics omg. people decided to hate on him without the full story and without hearing it from both sides️ “messing with my life as a career move” DAMNNNN;0.093;0.801;0.106;0.1384

This song is amazing. I remember when this love triangle made headlines. I was always on Josh’s side. But the fact Olivia never put things to rest at first, just spoke so many truths about who she was. She cared more about keeping the overnight fame and making money. I can only imagine the amount of hatred and death threats Josh and Sabrina faced. I’m glad Josh put these songs out there, they are amazing️;0.149;0.661;0.191;0.2999

People on Twitter who compare him to John Mayer or Jake Gyllenhaal are sick. Those two old men dated Taylor in their 30's but Josh and Olivia are basically still a kid compared to what happened in Taylor's relationship. If anything, Josh is more like Joe Jonas.;0.042;0.885;0.073;0.3694

I feel like he already responded with lie lie lie and that was his version of good for you and this song is his driver's license more remanicent of their relationship and calling out the wrong doing of the other partner.;0.067;0.817;0.116;0.3182

I didn’t like Olivia’s music, and it gave me Taylor Swift vibes in a bad way. I know she’s a huge Taylor fan so it makes sense. They both give off the “it’s all your fault, I did nothing wrong, and I’m going drag your for it, and complain and make excuses”. I don’t like that. Write how you feel in your music 100%. However if you’re going to use your music to intentionally throw shade at people, and not recognize how it could effect especially if they are not in a position to share their side, you’re problematic. Like actually, not me throwing around a word like 16 year old kid who is offended by everything, I mean actually problematic. Not once has she told her fans to back off, they still have to film a show together. I can’t vibe with that kind of behavior;0.108;0.768;0.124;0.1911

The reason why all the countries in the world cannot united into one country due to people forming their own belief. They always believe their own god is the greatest, their own race is the best, their own language is the best, their friends & family never did bad thing, their leader is the best and cannot be corrupted. Once people own their own belief divide & conquer is done. That is the reason why there were so many counties on earth. ;0.023;0.731;0.246;0.9736

When he says only what you say is half true as he says that he puts the blame right back on Olivia. Also what he says is only haft true to;0.067;0.778;0.156;0.4939
"Him saying her side is only half true doesn’t make sense. Like are you saying what she’s saying is half true or is what she saying entirely true and you wanna share your part too? The gaslight in this is cute because he’s saying she tried to leave first and yadda yadda, well duh… you were talking to a whole other girl and it’s evident since they’re dating. His side of the story lacks specific information unlike Olivia’s so it’s really hard to sympathize with him. People saying he won, won what? He’s accusing her of taking advantage of a crisis? Just because he’s late to the party doesn’t mean he’s not hypocritical. Olivia expressed her feelings truly and full of dignity. It’s what made her so popular and lovable. Things that he did to her is super relatable, his song writing skills point out stuff I just rolled my eyes at. That’s just my opinion ;) also remember when in driver license Olivia said Sabrina made her insecure and then Sabrina released her little protest that she’s got the man? LOL hope u keep him";0.058;0.686;0.256;0.9929

Good song but hasn’t there been like 4 songs him and the other girl have made about this? We get it y’all are young and let the industry blow up the personal situation.

I’m sorry but the actual song is awful and somebody’s gotta be the one to say it. Good for him for saying his truth but the difference between him and Olivia as songwriters is that Drivers license was symbolic and fans were the ones to figure out her reference. Everyone knows immediately what Josh is referencing cause it’s blatant. Also, Olivia’s music is very relatable. Like who is gonna sing this from their own experience with lyrics like “getting a call from my mom about death threats” or talking about his label? That’s not relatable. The concept of each person telling their own story is something very relatable and I believe could have been beautifully done here, but the difference between what Olivia did with her pain and what Josh did with his is Olivia created a beautiful song full of feeling and emotion that lots can relate to but Josh just sung what he wanted to say. Like bro could’ve just tweeted this song. Sure there was vulnerability and it rhymed but if anything this song was for him and that’s fine but if his music was truly good and I’m not even saying better than Olivia’s or anybody else’s, I’m just saying the music would speak for itself.;0.08;0.746;0.174;0.9752
